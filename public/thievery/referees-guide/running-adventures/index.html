<h2 id="facilitator-of-fun-and-adventure">
  Facilitator of Fun and Adventure
  <a class="anchor" href="#facilitator-of-fun-and-adventure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The referee should bring to life exciting adventures for the group&rsquo;s enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Before the game begins, the adventure should be planned and the required maps drawn. Advice on adventure design is found in <em><strong>Adventure Scenarios</strong></em>, <em><strong>Designing a Dungeon</strong></em>, <em><strong>Designing a Wilderness,</strong></em> and <em><strong>Designing a Base Town</strong></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Improvisation:</strong> Despite the referee’s preparation, predicting every possible player action is impossible. Players will come up with ideas that the referee has not even considered. Thus, the referee must remain flexible and roll with any unexpected turns the adventure might take!</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong> The game’s rules provide guidelines for many common adventuring situations. These exist to aid the referee in running the game. However, the referee should feel free to adapt and add to these procedures during play to keep the game moving.</p>
<p><strong>Balance:</strong> The referee must maintain a fun balance of risk and reward.</p>
<h2 id="neutral-judge">
  Neutral Judge
  <a class="anchor" href="#neutral-judge">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The referee must remain neutral in all things—neither on the side of the players nor against them.</p>
<p><strong>Non-competitive:</strong> The game is not a competition, with the players attempting to defeat the referee or vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Fairness:</strong> The game&rsquo;s rules should be applied equally to player characters, monsters, and NPCs.</p>
<h2 id="arbiter-of-rules">
  Arbiter of Rules
  <a class="anchor" href="#arbiter-of-rules">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The referee must decide when and how to apply the game rules.</p>
<p><strong>Rulings:</strong> The rules of the game—including descriptions of magic items, spells, or monsters’ special abilities—do not cover all possible scenarios, so the referee must be ready to apply judgment to resolve any unexpected situations that arise.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving actions:</strong> When a player wishes to do something not covered by a standard rule, the referee must consider how to determine the outcome. Sometimes, the situation can be dealt with by deciding what would happen. Sometimes, the referee may require the player to make an ability check (see <em><strong>Ability Checks</strong></em>) or a saving throw (see <em><strong>Saving Throws</strong></em>) to determine what happens. Other times, the referee may judge the likelihood of the action succeeding (e.g., expressed as a percentage or X-in-6 chance), tell the player the chances, and let them decide whether to take the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Disagreements:</strong> The players may not always agree with the referee’s application of the game&rsquo;s rules. When this happens, the group should (briefly!) discuss the point of disagreement and come to a decision. In such cases, the referee is always the final arbiter and should ensure the game does not get bogged down in lengthy discussions about the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Randomness:</strong> The referee should make judicious use of die rolls, random tables, etc. While these can add fun and unpredictability to the game, overuse of randomness can spoil an adventure by derailing it too much.</p>







  
  
  <h1 id="handling-pcs">
  Handling PCs
  <a class="anchor" href="#handling-pcs">#</a>
</h1>
<h2 id="rate-of-advancement">
  Rate of Advancement
  <a class="anchor" href="#rate-of-advancement">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Each group will have preferences regarding how quickly player characters gain experience points and increase in level.</p>
<p><strong>Standard:</strong> After three to four sessions, it is normal for at least one PC to have reached 2nd level. If this has not happened, the referee may wish to increase the amount of treasure. If, on the other hand, most PCs have reached 3rd level in this time frame, the referee might place less treasure or make monsters more challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Fast:</strong> The referee should place large treasure hoards for groups who prefer a game where characters advance quickly. These should, however, be guarded by appropriately challenging monsters.</p>
<p><strong>Slow:</strong> For groups who prefer the game to focus on character development rather than high risk, the rate of advancement and the danger presented by monsters may be reduced.</p>
<h2 id="character-knowledge">
  Character Knowledge
  <a class="anchor" href="#character-knowledge">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Attention must be paid to the distinction between what a player knows and what their PC knows. Players may sometimes act on information that their PC could not know. The referee may occasionally need to remind players of this and even forbid specific actions.</p>
<h2 id="grudges">
  Grudges
  <a class="anchor" href="#grudges">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Player characters may, through the course of play, naturally develop grudges or rivalries. This is especially true when characters of opposite alignments adventure together. This is a natural and fun part of good role-playing. However, the referee should ensure that such grudges do not dominate play and spoil the adventure for others.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-challenge">
  Maintaining Challenge
  <a class="anchor" href="#maintaining-challenge">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The referee must keep the game challenging, even when player characters have reached high levels and amassed great wealth and power.</p>
<p><strong>Magical research:</strong> Spell-casting characters may attempt to create new spells and magic items. When this happens, the referee should pay meticulous attention to game balance. Permanent magic, which may be used without limit, does not allow a saving throw, or increases in power with level can quickly become imbalanced. If in doubt, one option is to allow a new spell or item to be tested for a period, under the proviso that it may need to be altered if it proves to imbalance play.</p>
<p><strong>Special abilities:</strong> Players may sometimes try to find ways to gain special abilities and powers beyond their characters’ normal class abilities. The referee should be careful when allowing this, as it can lead to imbalance. The guidelines for magical research above should be used.</p>
<p><strong>Excess wealth:</strong> If the level of PC wealth has gotten out of hand, the referee may wish to find ways to take extra money away from the characters. This should always be done in such a way as to present the player with a choice, for example, pay a local tax or become an outlaw.</p>







  
  
  <h1 id="running-the-game">
  Running the Game
  <a class="anchor" href="#running-the-game">#</a>
</h1>
<h2 id="describing-the-unknown">
  Describing the Unknown
  <a class="anchor" href="#describing-the-unknown">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When describing what player characters experience during an adventure, the referee should be careful to keep an air of mystery. The best way to achieve this is to describe what characters see, hear, smell, and so on without providing additional information to the players.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters:</strong> Should be described rather than referred to by name. Players will recognize different types of monsters by their descriptions and behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Surprise attacks:</strong> When characters are attacked by surprise, the referee should describe the attack itself rather than giving players the complete description of the attacking monster. For example, a character may see a clawed hand reaching out of the shadows. Only in subsequent combat rounds should a more detailed description of the monster be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Monster and NPC game stats:</strong> The game statistics (e.g., hit points, level) of monsters and NPCs should never be revealed to players. In combat, the referee should describe the effects of damage on a monster rather than telling the players how many hit points it has remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Magic items:</strong> Should be described rather than referred to by name. Only by experimentation can players discover what powers a magic item has and whether an item is magical!</p>
<h2 id="describing-explored-areas">
  Describing Explored Areas
  <a class="anchor" href="#describing-explored-areas">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The usual procedure is for the players to draw maps of explored areas based on the referee’s descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Squares:</strong> One way to speed up mapping is to specify dimensions (e.g., the width and length of rooms in a dungeon) in terms of map squares rather than feet. Of course, the referee and the players must agree on the size of one map square.</p>
<p><strong>Known areas:</strong> Sometimes, characters may already know the shape of an explored area. In this case, the referee may draw the parts of the map which are already known.</p>
<p><strong>Complex areas:</strong> In the case of highly complicated areas, the referee may draw directly on the players’ map. This is not generally to be encouraged, however, as it does not help the players improve their mapping skills.</p>
<h2 id="using-miniatures">
  Using Miniatures
  <a class="anchor" href="#using-miniatures">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Some groups like using miniatures and a gridded tabletop surface to track exploration and combat.</p>
<p><strong>Play surface:</strong> The most convenient surface type is something maps can be drawn with erasable pens. The surface should be gridded for ease of tracking the movements of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> The typical scale used is 1” on the playing surface = 5’ in the game world (or 5 yards for outdoor encounters).</p>
<p><strong>Miniatures:</strong> Miniature figures are available to purchase from many different companies. Alternatively, simple tokens like dice or beads can be used.</p>







  
  
  <h1 id="monsters-and-npcs">
  Monsters and NPCs
  <a class="anchor" href="#monsters-and-npcs">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The referee is responsible for deciding how monsters and NPCs react when encountered and what schemes and tactics they follow when the PCs are elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="intelligence-and-tactics">
  Intelligence and Tactics
  <a class="anchor" href="#intelligence-and-tactics">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When deciding how a monster or NPC acts, the referee should bear its level of intelligence in mind. Intelligent monsters might use any of the following tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Traps and stealth:</strong> Monsters who are cunning but not physically powerful might lay traps or ambushes and may favor attacking PCs from a distance with missile weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Guards:</strong> Monsters may use guards or pets to weaken PCs or protect important escape routes.</p>
<p><strong>Magic items:</strong> Monsters will use any magic items in their lair to thwart the PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Learning and preparation:</strong> If PCs encounter but do not defeat monsters, the monsters will learn from the experience and prepare for a repeat attack. They may build defensive structures, call for reinforcements, relocate their base of operations, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Monsters may copy or adapt tactics successfully used by PCs and plan specific counter-moves.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork">
  Teamwork
  <a class="anchor" href="#teamwork">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When designing encounters, the referee should remember that—like player characters—monsters and NPCs will join forces to increase their chance of survival.</p>
<p><strong>Combined forces:</strong> Monsters skilled in melee, missile attacks, and magic may join forces.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders:</strong> May have special abilities, maximum hit points, or additional Hit Dice.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">
  Motivation
  <a class="anchor" href="#motivation">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The same as player characters, intelligent monsters and NPCs have their interests and motivations.</p>
<p><strong>Role-playing:</strong> The referee should consider the monster’s reaction to negotiations with PCs, considering its alignment and personality. Monsters should not always cooperate with PCs’ wishes!</p>
<p><strong>Allies:</strong> Monsters and NPCs may be encountered with friends, minions, or retainers. These will come to the aid of the monster or may avenge it if it is defeated.</p>







  
  
  <h1 id="adventure-scenarios">
  Adventure Scenarios
  <a class="anchor" href="#adventure-scenarios">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The first step in designing an adventure of any kind is to decide on the type of scenario. This hook draws the player characters to the adventure site and provides a background theme for the referee to tie the location together. The scenario drives the referee’s choices of specific traps, treasures, and monsters to be placed in the area. The following examples may be used for inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="1-banishing-ancient-evil">
  1. Banishing Ancient Evil
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-banishing-ancient-evil">#</a>
</h2>
<p>An evil presence (e.g., a monster or NPC) must be banished or destroyed. It may have been dormant for many years and only recently awakened (perhaps due to another party’s meddling).</p>
<h2 id="2-clearing-ruins">
  2. Clearing Ruins
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-clearing-ruins">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Settlers plan to move into an abandoned settlement or stronghold. Before they arrive, the PCs must scout the area and clear out any monsters or other dangers. The ruins need not be remote—they could even be within (or beneath) a significant settlement.</p>
<h2 id="3-contacting-a-lost-civilisation">
  3. Contacting a Lost Civilisation
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-contacting-a-lost-civilisation">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The PCs discover a long-lost race in a fantastic location. They may have once been human but now adapt to their strange environment. For example, they may have reverted to bestial behavior or may be adapted to subterranean life, with pale skin and infravision.</p>
<h2 id="4-escaping-from-captivity">
  4. Escaping from Captivity
  <a class="anchor" href="#4-escaping-from-captivity">#</a>
</h2>
<p>An enemy has taken the PCs prisoner, and they begin the adventure in captivity, possibly with a horrible fate awaiting them shortly. They must regain their freedom.</p>
<h2 id="5-exploring-unknown-territory">
  5. Exploring Unknown Territory
  <a class="anchor" href="#5-exploring-unknown-territory">#</a>
</h2>
<p>An NPC hires the party to explore and map an unknown region. This may be a previously uncharted area or a recent alteration to a familiar territory (e.g., a magic castle may appear in an empty plain).</p>
<h2 id="6-performing-a-quest">
  6. Performing a Quest
  <a class="anchor" href="#6-performing-a-quest">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A deity or powerful NPC (e.g., a king) sends the PCs on a quest. This may involve recovering holy or magical items.</p>
<h2 id="7-rescuing-captives">
  7. Rescuing Captives
  <a class="anchor" href="#7-rescuing-captives">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Bandits, wicked monsters, or an evil wizard have kidnapped important NPCs. The PCs attempt to rescue the prisoners, either seeking a reward or because of a personal connection with the unfortunate captives. The PCs may also be hired as bodyguards to NPCs negotiating with the kidnappers.</p>
<h2 id="8-scouting-an-enemy-outpost">
  8. Scouting an Enemy Outpost
  <a class="anchor" href="#8-scouting-an-enemy-outpost">#</a>
</h2>
<p>An invasion is looming (or in progress)! The PCs are tasked with infiltrating an enemy outpost, gathering intelligence on their plans, strengths, and weaknesses, and (if possible) destroying them.</p>
<h2 id="9-seeking-a-magical-doorway">
  9. Seeking a Magical Doorway
  <a class="anchor" href="#9-seeking-a-magical-doorway">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A gateway allows magical travel (either one-way or bidirectional) between distant locations or other worlds. The PCs may be tasked with locating a lost portal or closing a portal used by enemies. The portal may also be the only means of travel to a fantastic destination the PCs must visit.</p>
<h2 id="10-visiting-a-sacred-site">
  10. Visiting a Sacred Site
  <a class="anchor" href="#10-visiting-a-sacred-site">#</a>
</h2>
<p>To consult with an oracle, remove a curse, or find a holy relic, the PCs must journey to a sacred site (e.g., a shrine or temple). The exact location of the site is usually a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>Based on the selected adventure scenario and dungeon setting, decide what types of monsters inhabit the dungeon, choosing from any available monster books, creating new monsters specially for the dungeon, or tailoring standard monsters to the location.</p>
<h2 id="3-map-the-dungeon">
  3. Map the Dungeon
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-map-the-dungeon">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Overall shape:</strong> The dungeon setting will determine the structure of the rooms and connecting passages (e.g., rough cavern walls, carefully laid-out defensive structures, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Mapping scale:</strong> Typically, dungeon maps are drawn on graph paper with a 10’ per square scale. (Larger or smaller scales may be used as appropriate.)</p>
<p><strong>Numbering:</strong> Give each area (e.g., room or cave) of the dungeon a number so that the location on the map can easily be cross-referenced with the description of its contents (see step 4).</p>
<h2 id="4-stock-the-dungeon">
  4. Stock the Dungeon
  <a class="anchor" href="#4-stock-the-dungeon">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Make notes describing each area on the map that was given a number. Monsters, treasures, and areas that play an essential role in the adventure should be noted first. Areas of less importance may be stocked (using the guidelines below if desired).</p>
<p><strong>Important details:</strong> Monsters (including the possibility of patrols in the area), traps, tricks, treasures, or special magical effects that are present should be noted.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary details:</strong> Additional descriptive details for each area may also be noted: furnishings, everyday items, smells, sounds, lights, etc.</p>
<h3 id="dungeon-levels">
  Dungeon Levels
  <a class="anchor" href="#dungeon-levels">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Dungeons often consist of a series of deeper and deeper floors—known as &lsquo;<strong>levels&rsquo;</strong>—accessible by stairways, trap doors, chutes, pits, etc. PCs enter the 1st level of a dungeon initially and may discover entrances to deeper levels.</p>
<h3 id="danger-and-reward">
  Danger and Reward
  <a class="anchor" href="#danger-and-reward">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The level of danger and the amount of treasure in a dungeon should be suitable to the level of the PCs.</p>
<p>It is usual for lower levels of the dungeon to have greater risks and rewards. Normally, 1 HD monsters live in the 1st level of a dungeon, 2 HD monsters in the 2nd level, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="unguarded-treasure">
  Unguarded Treasure
  <a class="anchor" href="#unguarded-treasure">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Monsters or traps usually guard treasure, but sometimes, an unguarded cache of loot may be found.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced players:</strong> When designing dungeons for experienced players, the referee should consider placing only very few completely unguarded treasures.</p>
<p><strong>Deep dungeon levels:</strong> The referee may wish not to place any unguarded treasures in the 9th or deeper dungeon levels.</p>

  1. Choose the Setting
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-choose-the-setting">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Basic geography:</strong> Decide on the basic geography and climate of the region to be described, whether it primarily consists of mountains, forest, desert, etc. The size of the region should also be determined.</p>
<p><strong>Milieu:</strong> At this stage, the nature of the milieu being detailed should also be considered: the general level of technology, availability of magic, presence of different monsters and intelligent races, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>New campaigns:</strong> When starting a new campaign, it is recommended to begin by detailing a small, self-contained area that can be expanded upon over time.</p>
<h2 id="2-map-the-region">
  2. Map the Region
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-map-the-region">#</a>

<p><strong>Major terrain features:</strong> Using graph or hex paper, create a map of the wilderness area, marking the major terrain features such as mountain ranges, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, forests, swamps, etc. Real-world maps may serve as inspiration for the natural structure and relationship of terrain features.</p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> Typically, a large-scale map (24 miles per hex) is drawn first, followed by smaller-scale maps (6 miles per hex) of certain areas, adding more detail.</p>
<h2 id="3-locate-human-realms">
  3. Locate Human Realms

<p><strong>Government:</strong> Also note the ruler of each human-controlled area: a petty lord, a mighty king, a league of merchants, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Base town (see step 5):</strong> This is typically placed in one of these regions.</p>
<h2 id="4-locate-non-human-realms">
  4. Locate Non-Human Realms

<p>Mark regions controlled by other intelligent species in the setting (e.g., demihumans, monstrous races, and so on), taking their preferred environment and way of life into account.</p>
<p><strong>Nomads:</strong> Some intelligent species may keep domains with well-defined boundaries while others may move around—hunting or raiding—within a more vaguely defined area.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters:</strong> The territories of significant, non-intelligent monsters may also be marked on the map at this stage.</p>
<h2 id="5-place-the-base-town">
  5. Place the Base Town
  <a class="anchor" href="#5-place-the-base-town">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Locate a base town for player characters on the map, typically close to a river or road near the center of the map. This is where the play will begin. The guidelines in <em><strong>Designing a Base Town</strong></em> may flesh out the base town.</p>
<h2 id="6-place-dungeons">
  6. Place Dungeons
  <a class="anchor" href="#6-place-dungeons">#</a>

<p>Place one or more dungeons on the map somewhere near the base town.</p>
<p><strong>Distance:</strong> Dungeons are generally located around a day’s journey from the base town—close enough that travel between the town and the dungeon is convenient but not so close that the town is plagued by monsters from the dungeon.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Black market:</strong> For selling treasure and contacting thieves or smugglers.</li>
<li><strong>Guard:</strong> A town militia or police force to keep the peace and protect the town. It may be useful to note whether the guards are open to bribery and how frequently they patrol various areas of the town.</li>
<li><strong>Healing:</strong> Some means for characters to cure their wounds (and possibly more advanced services such as curing diseases or raising the dead). In settings where magical healing exists, such services may be available at a temple, church, or shrine.</li>
<li><strong>Lodgings:</strong> Rooms to rent, inns, etc.</li>

<h2 id="recovered-treasure">
  Recovered Treasure
  <a class="anchor" href="#recovered-treasure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Treasure that PCs bring back from an adventure is the primary means by which they gain XP—usually accounting for ¾ or more of the total XP earned.</p>
<p><strong>Non-magical treasure:</strong> Characters gain 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) value of the treasure.</p>
<p><strong>Magical treasure:</strong> Does not grant XP.</p>
<h2 id="defeated-monsters">
  Defeated Monsters
  <a class="anchor" href="#defeated-monsters">#</a>
</h2>
<p>All monsters defeated by the party (i.e., slain, outsmarted, captured, scared away, etc.) grant XP based on how powerful they are. See the table below.</p>
<p><strong>Base XP:</strong> The XP value of a monster is determined by its Hit Dice.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus XP / ability:</strong> A monster’s XP value is increased for each special ability it has. Special abilities are indicated by asterisks following the monster’s HD rating.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters with bonus hit points:</strong> Monsters whose HD are notated as a number of dice plus a fixed hit point bonus (e.g., HD 4+2) are more powerful and are listed separately in the table. For example, a monster with 2 HD is worth 20 XP, but a monster with 2+2 HD is worth 25 XP.</p>
<p><strong>Higher HD monsters:</strong> For each HD above 21, add 250 XP to the Base and Bonus amounts.</p>
<p><strong>Extraordinary peril bonus:</strong> A monster defeated under hazardous circumstances may be treated as one Hit Dice category higher on the table.</p>
