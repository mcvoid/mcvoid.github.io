  Party Organisation
  <a class="anchor" href="#party-organisation">#</a>
</h1>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> The ideal group size is between 6 and 8 characters—large enough to confront the challenges of the adventure while not so large as to be disorganized. If not enough PCs are present, the players may wish to hire retainers (see <em><strong>Retainers</strong></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Classes:</strong> It is wise for a party to have a mix of characters from different adventuring classes. Combat-focused characters are essential for protecting the group from danger, while other classes each have magic or other special abilities to handle different situations that may arise in an adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Level:</strong> As new PCs join play, the experience levels of the characters in the party may diverge. It is recommended that characters more than four levels apart should adventure separately, as challenges and rewards suitable to characters of vastly different experience levels do not match.</p>
<h2 id="marching-order">
  Marching Order
  <a class="anchor" href="#marching-order">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Before starting an adventure, the players should determine the typical arrangement of their PCs when exploring. This is known as the party’s <em><strong>marching order</strong></em>. For example, players may move in a two-column formation, with well-armored characters in the front, weaker characters in the middle, and a rear guard. The group may define standard marching orders for common situations (e.g., exploration, combat, opening doors, searching, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="the-caller">
  The Caller
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-caller">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If the players wish to, they may nominate one of their numbers as the spokesperson of the group, known as the caller. This player is responsible for informing the referee about the actions and movements of the party as a whole. Delegating this role to one player—rather than having each player notify the referee of their PC’s individual actions—can speed up play.</p>
<p>The caller’s character usually takes on the role of party leader and should thus have a high Charisma score and be located near the front of the party.</p>
<h2 id="the-mapper">
  The Mapper
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-mapper">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One player should create a map of the explored areas based on the referee’s descriptions. Details such as monsters or traps encountered, clues to puzzles, or possibly interesting unexplored areas may be noted on the map as it is drawn.</p>
<h2 id="dividing-treasure">
  Dividing Treasure
  <a class="anchor" href="#dividing-treasure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The spoils of an adventure may be divided between surviving characters in whatever way the players agree on.</p>
<p><strong>Non-magical treasure:</strong> This is typically divided evenly between player characters.</p>
<p><strong>Magic items:</strong> The players must decide which character keeps each item. One method is for each player to roll a die and compare the results. The highest-rolling player gets to pick a magic item first, the second-highest-rolling player gets the next pick, and so on.</p>







  
  
  <h1 id="time-weight-movement">
  Time, Weight, Movement
  <a class="anchor" href="#time-weight-movement">#</a>
</h1>
<h2 id="tracking-time">
  Tracking Time
  <a class="anchor" href="#tracking-time">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When an adventure is underway, the referee should keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world, known as <em><strong>game time</strong></em>. This is distinct from <em><strong>real time</strong></em>: what may take the players and referee mere seconds to describe may take PCs hours or even days to complete.</p>
<p>For example, when characters explore a dungeon, the referee tracks the number of turns that have elapsed; when characters are exploring the wilderness, the number of days elapsed is tracked.</p>
<p>The referee must adjudicate what may be accomplished in a given period.</p>
<h3 id="resources">
  Resources
  <a class="anchor" href="#resources">#</a>
</h3>
<p>As game time passes, the referee should pay attention to the resources that the party consumes. For example, food, water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical effects, etc.</p>
<h2 id="tracking-movement">
  Tracking Movement
  <a class="anchor" href="#tracking-movement">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As player characters explore the imagined world, the referee should keep track of their location on a prepared map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who must rely on the referee’s descriptions of the areas they explore.</p>
<p>The referee should refer to the characters&rsquo; movement rates to determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next (see <em><strong>Game Statistics</strong></em>).</p>
<h3 id="group-movement-rate">
  Group Movement Rate
  <a class="anchor" href="#group-movement-rate">#</a>
</h3>
<p>An adventuring party will usually want to stay together. The speed of the slowest member determines the movement rate of the party as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="measurements">
  Measurements
  <a class="anchor" href="#measurements">#</a>
</h2>
<h3 id="time-rounds-and-turns">
  Time: Rounds and Turns
  <a class="anchor" href="#time-rounds-and-turns">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Turns:</strong> 10 minutes of game time. There are six turns in an hour. Time is measured in turns when exploring dungeons (see <em><strong>Dungeon Adventuring</strong></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Rounds:</strong> 10 seconds of game time. There are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is measured in rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see <em><strong>Encounters</strong></em> and <em><strong>Combat</strong></em>).</p>
<h3 id="distance-inches-feet-yards-miles">
  Distance: Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles
  <a class="anchor" href="#distance-inches-feet-yards-miles">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This game uses imperial or customary US units to stay true to its origins. Distances are measured in inches (notated with a ”), feet (notated with a ’), yards, and miles.</p>
<h3 id="distance-conversions">
  Distance Conversions
  <a class="anchor" href="#distance-conversions">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 foot = 12 inches</li>
<li>1 yard = 3 feet</li>
<li>1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weight-coins">
  Weight: Coins
  <a class="anchor" href="#weight-coins">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Weight measures typically come into play only when discussing how much characters can carry (see <em><strong>Encumbrance</strong></em> below). As coins are the most common treasure adventurers find, all weights are measured in coins. (Ten coins are equivalent to one pound.)</p>
<h2 id="encumbrance-optional-rule">
  Encumbrance (Optional Rule)
  <a class="anchor" href="#encumbrance-optional-rule">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Some groups may wish to use a system to track the amount of gear and treasure a character can carry and how this affects their movement rate.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-encumbrance">
  Tracking Encumbrance
  <a class="anchor" href="#tracking-encumbrance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Encumbrance measures both the weight and bulk a character is carrying.</p>
<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> The encumbrance of treasure carried by a character should be tracked. The encumbrance of common items of treasure is shown in the table below. The referee should decide the weight of other forms of treasure.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Two options for tracking the encumbrance of characters’ equipment are presented below. The same system should be applied to all characters.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum load:</strong> Any character can carry 1,600 coins of weight. Characters carrying more than this cannot move.</p>

<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> The treasure&rsquo;s weight is tracked to ensure that the character’s maximum load is not exceeded.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> The weight of armor, weapons, and adventuring gear is not tracked and does not count toward a character’s maximum load.</p>
<p><strong>Movement rate:</strong> This is determined by the type of armor the character is wearing and whether they carry a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the referee). The actual weight of the treasure carried does not affect the movement rate.</p>

  Saving Throw Tables
  <a class="anchor" href="#saving-throw-tables">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Characters:</strong> Each character class has its table denoting the saving throw values of characters of each experience level.</p>
<p><strong>Monsters:</strong> Most monsters use the saving throw table under <em><strong>Combat Tables</strong></em>. Some monsters’ descriptions may note that they use the table for a specific character class.</p>

  Rolling a Saving Throw
  <a class="anchor" href="#rolling-a-saving-throw">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When affected by a spell or attack form that requires a saving throw, the player or referee must roll 1d20 and compare the result to the appropriate saving throw value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greater or equal:</strong> A result greater than or equal to the saving throw value is a success.</li>
<li><strong>Lower:</strong> A result of less than the saving throw value is a failure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="successful-saves">
  Successful Saves
  <a class="anchor" href="#successful-saves">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Damaging effects:</strong> A successful save against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved.</p>
<p><strong>Other effects:</strong> A successful saving throw against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.</p>
<h2 id="saving-throws-versus-poison">
  Saving Throws Versus Poison
  <a class="anchor" href="#saving-throws-versus-poison">#</a>

<p><strong>Failure:</strong> A failed save against poison is usually fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Damage:</strong> If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected by the success or failure of the saving throw.</p>
