To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 – Scope.\nLicense grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). Other rights.\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\nAttribution.\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a notice that refers to this Public License; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination.\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\nInability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n5.3.

This * limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or * personal injury resulting from such party\u0026rsquo;s negligence to the * extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Party Organisation # Size: The ideal group size is between 6 and 8 characters—large enough to confront the challenges of the adventure while not so large as to be disorganized. If not enough PCs are present, the players may wish to hire retainers (see Retainers).\nClasses: It is wise for a party to have a mix of characters from different adventuring classes. Combat-focused characters are essential for protecting the group from danger, while other classes each have magic or other special abilities to handle different situations that may arise in an adventure.\nLevel: As new PCs join play, the experience levels of the characters in the party may diverge. It is recommended that characters more than four levels apart should adventure separately, as challenges and rewards suitable to characters of vastly different experience levels do not match.\nMarching Order # Before starting an adventure, the players should determine the typical arrangement of their PCs when exploring. This is known as the party’s marching order. For example, players may move in a two-column formation, with well-armored characters in the front, weaker characters in the middle, and a rear guard. The group may define standard marching orders for common situations (e.g., exploration, combat, opening doors, searching, etc.).\nThe Caller # If the players wish to, they may nominate one of their numbers as the spokesperson of the group, known as the caller. This player is responsible for informing the referee about the actions and movements of the party as a whole. Delegating this role to one player—rather than having each player notify the referee of their PC’s individual actions—can speed up play.\nThe caller’s character usually takes on the role of party leader and should thus have a high Charisma score and be located near the front of the party.\nThe Mapper # One player should create a map of the explored areas based on the referee’s descriptions. Details such as monsters or traps encountered, clues to puzzles, or possibly interesting unexplored areas may be noted on the map as it is drawn.\nDividing Treasure # The spoils of an adventure may be divided between surviving characters in whatever way the players agree on.\nNon-magical treasure: This is typically divided evenly between player characters.\nMagic items: The players must decide which character keeps each item. One method is for each player to roll a die and compare the results. The highest-rolling player gets to pick a magic item first, the second-highest-rolling player gets the next pick, and so on.\nTime, Weight, Movement # Tracking Time # When an adventure is underway, the referee should keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world, known as game time. This is distinct from real time: what may take the players and referee mere seconds to describe may take PCs hours or even days to complete.\nFor example, when characters explore a dungeon, the referee tracks the number of turns that have elapsed; when characters are exploring the wilderness, the number of days elapsed is tracked.\nThe referee must adjudicate what may be accomplished in a given period.\nResources # As game time passes, the referee should pay attention to the resources that the party consumes. For example, food, water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical effects, etc.\nTracking Movement # As player characters explore the imagined world, the referee should keep track of their location on a prepared map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who must rely on the referee’s descriptions of the areas they explore.\nThe referee should refer to the characters\u0026rsquo; movement rates to determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next (see Game Statistics).\nGroup Movement Rate # An adventuring party will usually want to stay together. The speed of the slowest member determines the movement rate of the party as a whole.\nMeasurements # Time: Rounds and Turns # Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game.\nTurns: 10 minutes of game time. There are six turns in an hour. Time is measured in turns when exploring dungeons (see Dungeon Adventuring).\nRounds: 10 seconds of game time. There are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is measured in rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see Encounters and Combat).\nDistance: Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles # This game uses imperial or customary US units to stay true to its origins. Distances are measured in inches (notated with a ”), feet (notated with a ’), yards, and miles.\nDistance Conversions # 1 foot = 12 inches 1 yard = 3 feet 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet Weight: Coins # Weight measures typically come into play only when discussing how much characters can carry (see Encumbrance below). As coins are the most common treasure adventurers find, all weights are measured in coins. (Ten coins are equivalent to one pound.)\nEncumbrance (Optional Rule) # Some groups may wish to use a system to track the amount of gear and treasure a character can carry and how this affects their movement rate.\nTracking Encumbrance # Encumbrance measures both the weight and bulk a character is carrying.\nTreasure: The encumbrance of treasure carried by a character should be tracked. The encumbrance of common items of treasure is shown in the table below. The referee should decide the weight of other forms of treasure.\nEquipment: Two options for tracking the encumbrance of characters’ equipment are presented below. The same system should be applied to all characters.\nMaximum load: Any character can carry 1,600 coins of weight. Characters carrying more than this cannot move.\nTreasure Weight in Coins Coin (any type) 1 Gem 1 Jewellery (1 piece) 10 Potion 10 Rod 20 Scroll 1 Staff 40 Wand 10 Option 1: Basic Encumbrance # Treasure: The treasure\u0026rsquo;s weight is tracked to ensure that the character’s maximum load is not exceeded.\nEquipment: The weight of armor, weapons, and adventuring gear is not tracked and does not count toward a character’s maximum load.\nMovement rate: This is determined by the type of armor the character is wearing and whether they carry a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the referee). The actual weight of the treasure carried does not affect the movement rate.\nMovement Rate Armor Worn Without Treasure Carrying Treasure Unarmored 120’ (40’) 90’ (30’) Light armor 90’ (30’) 60’ (20’) Heavy armor 60’ (20’) 30’ (10’) Option 2: Detailed Encumbrance # Treasure: The weight of coins and other treasure carried is tracked.\nEquipment: The weight of the character’s armor and weapons is also tracked (the weight of these items is listed in the equipment list. Miscellaneous adventuring gear (backpack, spikes, sacks, etc.) may be counted as 80 coins of weight.\nMovement rate: The character’s movement rate is based on the weight of all significant items carried, including treasure, weapons, and armor.\nEncumbrance Movement Rate Up to 400 coins 120’ (40’) Up to 600 coins 90’ (30’) Up to 800 coins 60’ (20’) Up to 1,600 coins 30’ (10’) Ability Checks # The referee may use a character’s ability scores to determine the character’s chance of succeeding at various challenging tasks.\nRolling an Ability Check # The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the ability, the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.\nModifiers # Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be applied, depending on the difficulty of the task. A modifier of -4 would be a relatively easy ability check, and a +4 would be very difficult.\n1s and 20s # A natural 1 should be treated as a success and a natural 20 treated as a failure.\nDamage, Healing, and Death # All characters and monsters have a hit point total, representing their ability to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat, subtract hit points from this pool.\nDeath # A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.\nDestruction of Items # If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g., a lightning bolt spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.\nDestruction of Magic Items # Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell or special attack may be allowed a chance to survive, as follows:\nSave: For each item, a saving throw may be made using the character’s saving throw values. Bonuses: Items that grant a bonus in combat (e.g., magical weapons and armor) may also apply this bonus to the saving throw. Healing # Natural: A character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points for each full day of complete rest. The character or monster will not heal that day if the rest is interrupted.\nMagical: Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.\nSaving Throws # All characters and monsters can make saving throws to avoid the full effects of certain magical or special attacks.\nCategories # There are five saving throw categories used in the following situations:\nDeath or Poison (D): When targeted by a death ray or poison exposure. Wands (W): When targeted by an effect from a magical wand. Paralysis or Petrification (P): When targeted by an effect that paralyzes or turns to stone. Breath Attacks (B): When targeted by a dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath (or other monsters with a breath attack). Spells, Rods, or Staves (S): When targeted by a baneful spell or an effect from a magical rod or staff. When to Roll a Saving Throw # The appropriate saving throw and the effects of success or failure are indicated in the description of the spell, monster attack, or adventure scenario.\nSaving Throw Tables # Characters: Each character class has its table denoting the saving throw values of characters of each experience level.\nMonsters: Most monsters use the saving throw table under Combat Tables. Some monsters’ descriptions may note that they use the table for a specific character class.\nRolling a Saving Throw # When affected by a spell or attack form that requires a saving throw, the player or referee must roll 1d20 and compare the result to the appropriate saving throw value:\nGreater or equal: A result greater than or equal to the saving throw value is a success. Lower: A result of less than the saving throw value is a failure. Successful Saves # Damaging effects: A successful save against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved.\nOther effects: A successful saving throw against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.\nSaving Throws Versus Poison # Failure: A failed save against poison is usually fatal.\nDamage: If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected by the success or failure of the saving throw.\nCombat # Combat Sequence Per Round # Declare: Spells and melee movement. Initiative: Each side rolls 1d6. Winning side acts: Monster morale Movement Missile attacks Spell casting Melee attacks Other sides act: In initiative order. Declare Spells and Melee Movement # Players must inform the referee if they intend to cast a spell or move when in melee. Other actions need not be declared.\nInitiative # Roll 1d6: For each side at the start of each round.\nWinner: The side with the highest roll acts first. Other sides act in order from highest to lowest roll.\nTies: Both sides may roll again, or actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously; this means both sides may inflict deadly blows on each other!\nSlow Weapons # Combatants attacking with two-handed melee weapons (and some missile weapons—as indicated in the equipment description) always act last in the round, as if they had lost initiative.\nIndividual Initiative (Optional Rule) # Instead of an initiative roll per side, a roll may be made for each individual involved in a battle, modified by DEX (see Dexterity under Ability Scores). The referee may determine an initiative modifier for very fast or slow monsters instead of applying a DEX modifier.\nMonster Morale (Optional Rule) # See Morale (Optional Rule).\nMovement # Outside of Melee # Movement rate: Combatants can move up to their encounter movement rate each round.\nMaximum duration: Combatants may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds.\nIn Melee # When in melee with a foe, only the following forms of movement are possible:\nFighting withdrawal: The combatant moves backward at up to half their encounter movement rate. There must be clear space behind the combatant. Retreat: The combatant turns and flees from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. This round: the retreating combatant may not attack; the opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against the retreating combatant and ignores any AC bonus due to the combatant’s shield (if applicable). Missile Attacks # Possible when opponents are more than 5’ from one another (see Attacking).\nRange Modifiers # All missile weapons have ranges noted in the equipment lists.\nShort range: +1 bonus to attack rolls.\nMedium range: No bonuses or penalties.\nLong range: -1 penalty to attack rolls.\nBeyond long range: Attack not possible.\nTargets Behind Cover # Complete cover: The target cannot be hit.\nPartial cover: The referee may apply attack penalties of -1 thru -4 (e.g., a small table might incur a -1 penalty; dense woods might incur a -4 penalty).\nSpell Casting # Freedom: The spell caster must be able to speak and move their hands. A spellcaster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.\nSole action: No other actions may be taken in the round when casting a spell.\nNo movement: The spell caster cannot move and cast a spell in the same round.\nLine of sight: Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of effect) must be visible to the caster.\nDisrupting Spells # If a spell caster loses initiative and is successfully attacked or fails a saving throw before their turn, the spell being cast is disrupted and fails. It is removed from the caster’s memory as if it had been cast.\nMelee Attacks # Possible when opponents are 5’ or less from each other (see Attacking).\nOther Sides Act # Repeat steps 3.1 to 3.5 for each side, in order of initiative (highest first).\nAttacking # Attack Rolls # Roll 1d20 Apply modifiers: STR for melee; DEX, range, cover for missile attacks. Determine hit AC: Look up the result in the attack matrix row for the attacker’s THAC0 (see Combat Tables). This column is the AC score that the attack hits. Result: If the hit AC is equal to or lower than the opponent’s AC, the attack hits. Referee rolls for damage. Ascending Armor Class (Optional Rule) # Groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC (see Game Statistics) should use the following attack procedure instead.\nRoll 1d20 Apply modifiers: STR for melee; DEX, range, cover for missile attacks. Determine hit AC: Add the attackers’s attack bonus to the attack roll. The result is the ascending AC score that the attack hits. Result: If the hit AAC is equal to or higher than the opponent’s AAC, the attack hits. Referee rolls for damage. 1s and 20s # Natural 20 attack rolls always hit. Natural 1 attack rolls always miss.\nInvulnerabilities # Some monsters are immune to certain attacks. In this case, damage is not rolled even if an attack hits.\nAttacks Per Round # PCs normally attack once per round. Some monsters have multiple attacks.\nAttacking and Moving # Movement and attacking may be combined in the same round.\nRolling for Damage # PC attacks: Inflict 1d6 damage. STR modifies the damage of melee attacks.\nMonster attacks: Deal damage as indicated in the monster’s description.\nMinimum damage: An attack that hits always deals at least one point of damage, even when damage modifiers reduce the number rolled to 0 or less.\nDeath: A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.\nVariable Weapon Damage (Optional Rule) # Some groups may prefer different weapons to inflict different amounts of damage. In this case, PC attacks inflict the damage indicated for the weapon in the equipment lists.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/thievery/referees-guide/adventures/","title":"Adventures: Thievery! Referee's Guide","section":"Thievery! Referee's Guide","content":" Hazards and Challenges # Climbing # When climbing in a difficult or pressured situation, the referee may require a DEX check to avoid falling.\nSheer Surfaces # Very steep or sheer surfaces are usually only possible to climb with specialized equipment. Some characters may have class abilities that allow them to attempt to climb such surfaces unaided.\nDarkness # Characters usually want to bring a light source with them on underground expeditions. Typical light sources enable normal vision within a 30’ radius.\nInfravision # All non-human monsters and many demihuman races have a special vision, allowing them to see in the dark. This is called infravision.\nHeat tones: Characters with infravision can see heat tones, with warm objects (such as living creatures) appearing bright, cold objects as black, and cool objects as grey.\nReading: It is impossible to read in the dark with infravision because fine detail cannot be perceived.\nRange: Infravision works within a limited range (60’ for monsters, unless specified otherwise in a monster’s description).\nDisruption: Visible light (normal or magical) and large heat sources prevent infravision from functioning.\nLight and Surprise # Parties carrying a light in a dark environment usually cannot surprise others (see Encounters) because the light gives away their presence.\nFalling # Falling from a height onto a hard surface inflicts 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen.\nLosing Direction # When traveling with a reliable guide, following a trail or river, or heading toward a prominent landmark, there is no risk of getting lost. Otherwise, there is a chance of getting lost in the untracked wilds.\nThe chance of the party becoming lost depends on the type of terrain being explored (see Wilderness Adventuring and Waterborne Adventuring.\nEffects of Being Lost # If the party becomes lost, the referee will decide how far off course they are traveling (possibly at random). For example, if the party intends to head north, the referee may determine they are heading northeast.\nIt may take time for a lost party to realize it is moving in the wrong direction.\nStarvation # Characters who go without food or water for a whole day or longer may begin to suffer penalties at the referee’s discretion, for example, attack penalties, reduced movement rate, more frequent need to rest, or a slow loss of hit points.\nSwimming # Movement rate: Characters can swim at half their normal movement rate.\nWho can swim: Unless there is an apparent reason why a character could not have learned to swim, it is assumed that all characters can swim.\nDrowning # The circumstances in which drowning is a risk — as well as the chance of drowning — are judged by the referee.\nExample circumstances: Swimming in treacherous water conditions, swimming while wearing armor or carrying heavy or awkward items, fighting in water.\nExample chances of drowning: A character swimming in rough waters while wearing heavy armor and carrying a heavy load may have a 99% probability of drowning. A character in the same waters but wearing light armor and carrying a light load may only have a 10% probability of drowning.\nWandering Monsters # Besides the monsters placed explicitly in some areas of a dungeon or wilderness, PCs may randomly encounter monsters on the move between areas. These are known as wandering monsters.\nSee Dungeon Adventuring, Wilderness Adventuring, and Waterborne Adventuring for specific details.\nFrequency: The referee should roll periodically to determine whether a wandering monster is encountered. The frequency of checks depends on the type of area being explored.\nChance: When a wandering monster check is made, the chance of a random encounter is usually 1-in-6. This chance may vary, depending on the area being explored (e.g., dungeon region or level, type of wilderness terrain).\nMonster type: Each area should have a table of wandering monsters, which the referee rolls on when an encounter occurs.\nNoise or light: If the party makes a lot of noise or carries bright light sources in a dark environment, the referee may increase the chance of encountering wandering monsters.\nHiding: If the party rests quietly in an out-of-the-way location, the referee may decrease the chance of encountering wandering monsters.\nDungeon Adventuring # Sequence of Play Per Turn # Wandering monsters: The referee makes checks as applicable. Actions: The party decides what action to take (e.g., moving, searching, listening, entering rooms). Description: The referee describes what happens. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in Encounters. End of turn: The referee updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest. Doors # Doors are common in many dungeons: some hidden, some obvious, some locked, and some stuck.\nSearching for Secret Doors # Some doors are hidden or concealed. Adventurers may search a 10’ × 10’ area for secret doors (see Searching).\nChance of finding: If a character is searching in the right location, there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a secret door. (Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance.)\nStuck Doors # Forcing: The chance of forcing open a stuck door depends on the character’s Strength (see Ability Scores).\nSurprise: A failed attempt to force open a door eliminates any possibility of surprise (see Encounters) that the party may have against any monsters on the other side of the door.\nLocked Doors # Locks may be picked by a character proficient with lock picks or opened by magic.\nDoors Swinging Shut # Doors opened by adventurers (by whatever means) are likely to swing shut after they pass. To prevent this, doors may be held open using iron spikes or other wedges.\nMonsters and Doors # Monsters living in the dungeon can usually open doors (even stuck ones) unless they are blocked, magically closed, or wedged shut with spikes.\nListening at Doors # Chance of success: PCs have a 1-in-6 chance of detecting subtle sounds beyond a door. (Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance of success.)\nReferee rolls: The referee should always roll for the character listening so that the player never knows if the roll failed or if there simply is no sound behind the door.\nOne chance: Each character may only make one attempt to listen at each door.\nSilent monsters: Some monsters (e.g., undead) cannot be detected by listening.\nMovement # Exploring the unknown: When exploring unknown dungeon areas, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn. This prolonged rate of movement accounts for PCs exploring in a dark, unfamiliar environment, moving carefully and stealthily, and mapping their progress.\nIn familiar areas: When PCs are moving through dungeon areas with which they are familiar, the referee may allow them to move at a faster rate. For example, the referee might allow PCs to move three times their base movement rate per turn when moving through familiar areas.\nResting # Frequency of rest: Characters must rest for one turn every hour in the dungeon.\nPenalty for not resting: A –1 penalty to attack and damage rolls is incurred until the characters rest for one turn.\nSearching # The following stipulations apply to searching for secret doors, room traps, and treasure traps.\nTime: Searching takes one turn.\nReferee rolls: The referee should always roll for the character searching so that the player does not know if the roll failed or if there are simply no hidden features present.\nOne chance: Each character can only make one attempt to search a specific area or item.\nTraps # There are two kinds of traps:\nRoom traps: Large traps designed to affect anyone entering a particular area (e.g., a pit that opens on the floor when walked over). Treasure traps: Small traps placed on an item to prevent it from being tampered with or stolen (e.g., a poison needle on a chest or lock). Triggering Traps # Each trap has a trigger—an action that causes it to spring (e.g., turning a door handle and walking into a specific area).\nChance of triggering: When a character performs the action that triggers a trap, there is a 2-in-6 chance of the trap being sprung.\nTrap damage: Damage inflicted by a triggered trap is usually automatic, without an attack roll.\nMonsters: Monsters may be able to bypass traps without risk, if the referee wishes.\nSearching for Room Traps # Adventurers may search a 10’ × 10’ area for room traps. If the search succeeds, the trap is discovered (see Searching).\nChance of finding: If a character is searching in the right location, there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a room trap. (Some types of adventurers may have an increased chance.)\nSearching for Treasure Traps # Characters with the ability to find treasure traps (as noted in their class description) may choose to search items (e.g., chests, locks) for traps (see Searching).\nChance of finding: The likelihood of finding treasure traps if a character searches in the right location is noted in the character’s class description.\nWandering Monsters # Frequency: A check is typically rolled once every two turns in the dungeon.\nChance: The typical chance of encountering a wandering monster is 1-in-6.\nDistance: Wandering monsters are encountered 2d6 × 10 feet away, moving toward the party.\nWilderness Adventuring # Sequence of Play Per Day # Decide course: The players decide on their path of travel for the day. Losing direction: The referee determines whether the party gets lost. Wandering monsters: The referee makes checks as applicable. Description: The referee describes the terrain passed through and any sites of interest the party encounters, asking players for their actions, as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in Encounters. End of day: The referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest. Distance and Measurement # The open spaces of the wilderness mean that characters and monsters can move more freely than in a dungeon.\nRanges and movement rates: These are measured in yards instead of feet. This means that ranges and movement rates are tripled.\nAreas: Spell effects, breath weapons, etc., are still measured in feet.\nFlying # Miles per day: The distance a creature can fly in a day is double the distance it can travel overland (see Overland Travel). For example, a creature with a movement rate of 120’ could travel 24 miles overland but could fly 48 miles in a day.\nTerrain: Does not affect air travel.\nFlying Mounts # In general, a winged beast may carry riders or other burdens based on its HD:\n3 HD creatures: They may carry a being about half the size of an adult human. 6 HD creatures: They may carry an adult human. 12 HD creatures: They may carry a large animal like a horse. 24 HD creatures: They may carry a massive animal like an elephant. Foraging # Foraging for herbs, fruits, nuts, etc., can be performed alongside normal movement (see Overland Travel). The party has a 1-in-6 chance per day of finding enough food for 1d6 human-sized beings.\nHunting # Hunting animals takes up a complete day, with no traveling or resting possible. When hunting, there is a 1-in-6 chance of encountering animals suitable for eating (if they can be caught!). This is in addition to the normal chance of random encounters (see Wandering Monsters).\nLosing Direction # At the start of each day of travel, the referee should roll to determine if the group loses direction. The probability depends on the terrain being traversed:\nClear, grasslands: 1-in-6. Barren lands, hills, mountains, woods: 2-in-6. Desert, jungle, swamp: 3-in-6. Effects: See Losing Direction.\nOverland Travel # Miles per day: The number of miles a character can travel daily is determined by dividing their base movement rate by five. For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could travel up to 24 miles daily.\nTerrain Modifiers # Some types of terrain modify the speed at which characters can travel:\nBroken lands, desert, forest, hills: 33% slower. Jungle, mountains, swamp: 50% slower. Maintained roads: 50% faster. Forced March # If characters need to travel further in a day, they may engage in a forced march.\nSpeed increase: The distance traveled is increased by 50%. For example, a character typically traveling 24 miles daily could travel 36 miles.\nRest: After a forced march, characters must rest for a full day.\nResting # Frequency of rest: Characters must rest for one day per six days of travel.\nPenalty for not resting: If characters press on without resting, they suffer a penalty of -1 to hit and damage rolls until they have rested for one whole day.\nSurprise # Surrounded: If a party is surprised by three or more monsters, the monsters may have moved to encircle the party.\nVisibility # Characters can usually see for three miles around them in open terrain. This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g., in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g., looking out from the top of a mountain).\nWandering Monsters # Frequency: A check is typically rolled once daily, but the referee may choose to make more checks, up to three or four per day.\nChance: The chance of encountering a wandering monster depends on the explored terrain (see below).\nDistance: Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either side is surprised (see Encounters), this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.\nChance by Terrain # City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6. Aerial, barren, desert, forest, hills: 2-in-6. Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6. Waterborne Adventuring # Sequence of Play Per Day # Decide course: The players decide on their course of travel for the day. Losing direction: The referee determines whether the party gets lost. Weather: The referee determines the Wind Conditions. Wandering monsters: The referee makes checks as applicable. Description: The referee describes the regions passed through and any sites of interest the party has, asking players for their actions, as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in Encounters. End of day: The referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the crew’s need to rest. Distance and Measurement # Ranges and movement rates: These are measured in yards instead of feet. This means that ranges and movement rates are tripled.\nAreas: Spell effects, breath weapons, etc., are still measured in feet.\nLosing Direction # With a navigator aboard: The chance of getting lost is 2-in-6.\nWithout a navigator aboard: The chance of getting lost is 100% on the open seas and 2-in-6 within sight of land.\nEffects: See Losing Direction.\nSurprise # Aquatic monsters are usually not surprised by ships. Special circumstances (e.g., thick fog) may alter this.\nTravel on the Water # Miles per day: The number of miles a creature or vessel can travel daily is determined by dividing its base movement rate by five. For example, a vessel with a base movement rate of 360’ could travel up to 72 miles in a day.\nModifiers # The distance traveled in a day may be affected by the prevailing water and weather conditions:\nRiver travel: Water currents may increase (when moving downstream) or decrease (when moving upstream) the distance traveled by 1d6+6 miles per day. Sailing: The movement rate of sailing vessels is affected by the prevailing wind conditions (see Wind Conditions). Visibility # Land: On a clear day, land can be spotted at a distance of 24 miles. This may be reduced based on light and weather conditions.\nShips: May be sighted and identified at 300 yards on a clear day or as little as 40 yards in dense fog.\nWandering Monsters # Frequency: A check is typically rolled once daily, but the referee may choose to make more checks, up to 3 or 4 a day.\nChance: The chance of encountering a wandering monster is 2-in-6 in oceans or rivers and 3-in-6 in swamps.\nDistance: Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either side is surprised (see Encounters), this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.\nLocation: Aquatic encounters may occur on the open water or land, if the party docks at some point during the day.\nWind Conditions # Wind conditions at sea affect the rate at which a sailing vessel can travel. Extreme winds can also make travel hazardous. The referee should check the wind conditions at the start of each day, rolling 2d6:\n2: No wind; sailing is not possible. 3–11: Normal sailing is possible. 12: Gale or storm; sailing vessels’ speed tripled (see Gales and Storms). Variable Wind Conditions (Optional Rule) # Groups who prefer a slightly more detailed system of sea travel may use the table below, which adds extra detail to the daily 2d6 wind conditions roll.\n2d6 Wind Effect 2 No wind Sailing is impossible—movement by oar at ⅓ rate (due to fatigue). 3 Faint breeze Sailing movement rate reduced to ⅓ normal. 4 Gentle breeze Sailing movement rate reduced to ½ normal. 5 Moderate breeze Sailing movement rate reduced to ⅔ normal. 6–8 Fresh breeze Normal sailing movement rate. 9 Strong breeze Sailing movement rate increased by ⅓. 10 High wind Sailing movement rate increased by ½. 11 Near gale Sailing movement rate doubled. See #Near Gales. 12 Gale or storm Sailing movement rate tripled. See #Gales and Storms. Near Gales # Seaworthy vessels: Have a 10% chance of taking on water.\nUnseaworthy vessels: Have a 20% chance of taking on water.\nEffect of taking on water: The ship’s movement is reduced by one-third until repaired at a dock.\nGales and Storms # Seaworthy vessels: Sailing vessels can attempt to move with the wind to avoid damage. This is handled as follows:\nThe vessel travels at three times its normal speed in a randomly determined direction. (The referee may roll 1d6, with 1 indicating the intended direction of travel, 2 indicating 60° to the right, 3 indicating 120° to the right, and so on.) If the ship encounters land during this travel, there is a 75% chance of it wrecking against the shore. Unseaworthy vessels:\nThere is an 80% chance of the vessel being overrun with water and sinking. If the vessel is in sight of land when the gale hits, it may attempt to beach. If the shore is relatively clear of physical dangers (rocks, cliffs, etc.), this is automatically successful; otherwise, there is a 2-in-6 chance of finding a safe harbor to weather the storm. Encounters # An encounter begins when characters meet a monster due to a planned encounter in the explored area or because a wandering monster check (see Wandering Monsters) indicates an encounter.\nEncounter Sequence # Surprise: The referee rolls for surprise, if applicable. Encounter Distance: The referee determines how far away the monsters are from the PCs. Initiative: Any sides that are not surprised roll initiative to determine who acts first. Actions: Any sides that are not surprised decide how they will respond to the encounter. The encounter is played out accordingly. Conclusion: One turn has passed. Surprise # When to Check # A check for surprise is made for any side that is not expecting the encounter. For example, if a monster spotted an approaching party’s torch light and waited quietly, the monster would not need to roll surprise, but the party would.\nLight and Surprise # Characters or monsters that carry a light in a dark environment usually cannot surprise opponents because the light gives their presence away.\nSurprise Checks # Each side that is unaware of the other’s presence rolls 1d6.\nMonsters: The referee rolls for monsters.\nPCs: One player rolls for the adventuring party as a whole.\nResults: A result of 1 or 2 means the side is surprised.\nEffects of Surprise # Both sides surprised: There is simply a momentary confusion—neither side has any advantage.\nOne side surprised: The side that is not surprised gains a one-round advantage. The surprised side cannot act that round.\nEncounter Distance # The situation in which the encounter occurs often determines how far away the monster is. If there is uncertainty, the encounter distance may be determined randomly:\nDungeon: 2d6 × 10 feet. Wilderness: 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 × 10 yards if either side is surprised). Waterborne: 4d6 × 10 yards (or 1d4 × 10 yards if either side is surprised). Initiative # (See Combat for complete details.)\nRoll 1d6: For each side, at the start of each round.\nWinner: The side with the highest roll acts first, followed by other sides in order from highest to lowest initiative.\nTies: Both sides may roll again, or actions on both sides may be resolved simultaneously.\nActions # Player Character Actions # The players decide how they will act.\nMonster Actions # The referee determines the monsters’ reaction to the party. Sometimes, circumstances make it obvious how a monster will react. Otherwise, the referee may roll on the table below to determine how a monster reacts to the party.\nCharisma: If one specific character attempts to speak with the monsters, that character’s NPC reactions modifier due to CHA (see Ability Scores) is used to modify the monster reaction roll.\n2d6 Result 2 or less Attacks 3–5 Hostile, may attack 6–8 Uncertain, confused 9–11 Indifferent, may negotiate 12 or more Eager, friendly Common Actions # Any action is possible in an encounter, but the following are common:\nCombat: If one side attacks, casts spells, or makes tactical movements, begin tracking time in rounds, following the combat procedure (see Combat). Evasion: If one side decides to flee, the other may choose to pursue (see Evasion). Parley: PCs may attempt to communicate with monsters. Opening an encounter in this way can influence the monsters’ behavior (see Monster Actions). If both sides decide to talk, the negotiation may be role-played. Movement # Encounter movement rate: During encounters, a character can move up to one-third of their base movement rate per round in feet (in the dungeon) or yards (in the wilderness). For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could move 40’ per round during a dungeon encounter.\nMaximum duration: Characters may move at this rate for at most 60 rounds (one turn).\nEvasion # If one side wishes to avoid an encounter, it may attempt to flee. This is called evasion and is only possible before combat has begun. When a side decides to try an evasion, the opposing side must decide whether or not to pursue it. Players May decide freely whether they wish to pursue fleeing monsters.\nMonsters: The referee must decide whether monsters pursue fleeing PCs. (A low roll on the Monster Reactions table may be taken to indicate that the monster will pursue.)\nNo pursuit: If the opposing side decides to let the other side flee, the evasion automatically succeeds; the encounter is avoided.\nPursuit: If the opposing side gives chase, the chance of the evasion succeeding depends on the explored environment. See Evasion and Pursuit.\nConclusion # An encounter is assumed to take at least one full turn to complete, including time to rest, regroup, clean weapons, bind wounds, and so on afterward.\nEvasion and Pursuit # In the Dungeon # Evasion # Compare the two sides’ movement rates:\nFleeing side faster: The evasion automatically succeeds, unless the fleeing side is forced to stop. Fleeing side not faster: A pursuit occurs. Pursuit # Time: This is measured in rounds (see Time, Weight, Movement).\nRunning: Each side is expected to run at full speed (see below).\nLine of sight: Most monsters will not continue pursuing if the characters get out of the monster’s range of vision.\nDropping treasure: If the monsters enjoy treasure, there is a 3-in-6 probability that they will stop pursuing to collect any treasure the characters drop.\nDropping food: Hungry or less intelligent monsters may stop pursuit if characters drop food (3-in-6 chance).\nObstacles: Burning oil or other obstacles may slow or stop a pursuit.\nRunning # Movement rate: During a pursuit, characters run at their full movement rate in feet per round.\nMapping: This is not possible while running.\nExhaustion: Characters become exhausted after running for 30 rounds.\nEffects of exhaustion: A -2 penalty to attacks, damage, and Armor Class.\nResting: The penalties for exhaustion last until characters have rested for three full turns.\nWaterborne # Evasion # The chance of evasion is determined by the difference between the two sides’ movement rates, listed in the table below.\nSuccess: If the evasion roll succeeds, the pursuers cannot attempt to catch up with the fleeing side until the next day—only if a random encounter roll indicates an encounter.\nFailure: If the evasion roll fails, a pursuit occurs.\nFleeing Side’s Movement Rate (Compared with the Pursuer’s) Chance of Evasion Faster than pursuer 80% 0’–30’ per round slower than pursuer 50% 31’–60’ per round slower than pursuer 40% 61’–90’ per round slower than pursuer 35% 91’–120’ per round slower than pursuer 25% 121’+ per round slower than pursuer 10% Pursuit # Time: Is measured in rounds (see Time, Weight, Movement.\nInitial distance: The two sides begin a pursuit at normal encounter distance (see Waterborne Adventuring.\nClosing in: The distance between the two sides decreases by the difference between their two movement rates each round (a minimum of 30’ per round).\nIn the Wilderness # Evasion # The chance of evasion is a percentile roll. If the percentile evasion roll fails, a pursuit occurs. Surprise (see Encounters) determines the chance of evasion:\nNo surprise: If neither side is surprised, the chance of evasion is determined by the relative size of the two groups. (The chances are in favor of the smaller group, as larger groups cannot move as fast or as quietly.) The Wilderness Evasion Base Chance table indicates the base chance of evasion. Surprised side: It may generally not evade. The referee may rule that environmental conditions give a slight chance of evasion even when surprised (as above). For example, dense woodland may give a surprised side a 10% chance of evasion. Surprising side: If one side has surprised the other, the side with surprise may evade automatically—the surprised side is not even aware that the encounter occurred. Fleeing Group Size Chance of Evasion by Number of Pursuers 1–4 1 pursuer: 50% 2–3 pursuers: 70% 4+ pursuers: 90% 5–12 1–3 pursuers: 35% 4–8 pursuers: 50% 9+ pursuers: 70% 13–24 1–6 pursuers: 25% 7–16 pursuers: 35% 17+ pursuers: 50% 25+ 1–10 pursuers: 10% 11–30 pursuers: 25% 31+ pursuers: 35% Evasion Modifiers # One side twice as fast: If the pursuing side’s movement rate is double that of the other, the chance of evasion is decreased by 25%. If the fleeing side’s movement rate is double that of the other, the chance of evasion is increased by 25%.\nEnvironment: The referee may modify the probabilities based on the conditions and environment. For example, in a densely wooded area, the chance of evasion may be increased by 25%.\nMinimum chance: The chance of escape is always at least 5%.\nPursuit # The following procedure is followed, day by day, until the pursuit is over:\nThe fleeing side moves in a random direction, determined by the referee (no mapping is possible). If the pursuing side’s movement rate is greater than that of the fleeing side, there is a 50% chance of it catching up. If the roll succeeds, the fleeing side has been caught; the pursuit is over. Otherwise, continue to step 3. The fleeing side must decide whether to continue fleeing. If it continues, it may attempt another evasion (see above). If the effort to evade fails, return to step 1. If the fleeing group decides to stop fleeing, it is caught (the pursuit ends). Other Combat Issues # Attacking from Behind # AC bonuses from shields are negated.\nBlindness # A blind character is unable to attack.\nBombing # Flying creatures may pick up rocks or other objects and drop them from above.\nAltitude: At most 300’.\nChance to hit: 16 or higher on 1d20.\nAffected area and damage: Depending on the size of the bomb—larger creatures can carry larger bombs. For example, a bomb from a flying creature able to carry a human might inflict 2d6 damage to all creatures hit in a 10’ × 10’ area.\nInvulnerabilities (Optional Rule) # Some monsters can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons. The referee may allow such monsters also to be harmed by attacks from:\nAnother invulnerable monster. A monster with 5 HD or greater. Paralyzed Opponents # Helpless opponents, such as those magically paralyzed or frozen, can be automatically hit in melee. Only a roll for damage is required.\nSpacing # The referee should judge the number of opponents that can attack a single combatant, considering the combatant’s size and the available space around them.\n10’ passage: Enough space for at most 2–3 characters to fight side-by-side.\nSubduing (Optional Rule) # Characters that wish to subdue an intelligent opponent may declare the intent to attack without killing.\nBlunt blows: Only bludgeoning attacks may be made. Bladed melee weapons can deal blunt blows by attacking with the flat of the blade.\nSubdual damage: Attack and damage rolls are handled normally, but subdual damage is noted separately from actual damage.\nEffect at 0 HP: An intelligent character or monster reduced to 0 hit points due to subdual damage will surrender, realizing that its opponent could have killed it.\nUnarmed Attacks # Attack rolls: Unarmed combat is handled the same as melee combat.\nDamage: Unarmed attacks inflict 1d2 damage, modified by STR.\nUnstable Surfaces # Characters on an unstable surface, such as a ship in rough seas or riding a flying animal, are affected as follows:\nMissile attacks: Suffer a -4 penalty. Spells: Cannot be cast. Magic items: Can be used normally. Note that magical means of flight (e.g., a broom of flying, flying carpet, fly spell) generally do not count as unstable.\nWater # When fighting in or beneath water:\nPenalties: Attack and damage rolls should be penalized. Missile weapons: Usually do not work at all underwater. Morale (Optional Rule) # The referee decides whether monsters or NPCs surrender or run away in combat. The following system may be utilized.\nMorale Rating # Monsters are rated for morale with a number from 2–12. This represents their courage in battle. Higher morale scores indicate more fearless monsters.\nA score of 2: Means the monster will not fight. No morale checks should be made.\nA score of 12: Means the monster fights to the death, never checking morale.\nMorale Checks # The referee rolls 2d6 and compares the result against the monster’s morale score:\nHigher than morale score: The monster will surrender or attempt to flee. Equal to or lower than morale score: The monster will continue to fight. Two successes: If a monster makes two successful morale checks in an encounter, it will fight until killed, with no further checks necessary.\nWhen to Check Morale # Monsters make morale checks (rolled by the referee) in two circumstances:\nFirst death on side: The first time one of their number is killed in battle.\nSide half incapacitated: When half the monsters are incapacitated (slain, paralyzed, etc.).\nSituational Adjustments # Based on the situation, the referee may apply morale modifiers from –2 to +2. For example, the side losing a battle might suffer a –1 morale penalty, while the side winning may gain a +1 bonus.\nScores of 2 or 12: Adjustments are never applied to monsters with a morale of 2 or 12.\nMercenary Morale # Mercenaries (see Mercenaries) have a morale rating and check morale exactly like monsters.\nMorale rating: Determined solely by the type of troops; see below. The CHA of the hiring character has no influence.\nModifiers: The referee may penalize mercenaries’ morale in poor conditions (e.g., low wages, abuse, frequent death) or raise it in good conditions (e.g., riches, glory in battle).\nTroop Type Morale Untrained, militia 6 Barbarian horde 7 Trained warriors 8 Mounted +1 Elite troops +1 Fanatics, berserkers +2 Retainer Morale # Retainers signed up to work as adventurers, so are not frightened off at the first sign of danger. Retainers do not make morale checks in combat, but a loyalty check may be required in extreme peril (see Retainers).\nCombat Tables # These tables list the attack probabilities for all monsters and characters and the saving throw values used by monsters and normal humans.\nNormal Humans # All humans, not a member of an adventuring class, are classified as normal humans. They are treated as having less than 1 Hit Die and have their own saving throw and attack probabilities (the table rows labelled NH).\nExample of Making an Attack Roll # A 5th-level fighter attacks a monster with AC 4. The attack is resolved as follows:\nThe player rolls 1d20. The roll comes up 14. The fighter has a STR score 13, meaning they gain a +1 bonus to melee attack rolls. The result of the attack roll is thus 15. A 5th-level fighter has a THAC0 score of 17 [+2] (listed in the class description, so the player refers to that row of the attack matrix. The player looks up the result (15) in the THAC0 17 [+2] attack matrix row. 15 is in the AC 2 column, indicating that the attack hits AC 2. As AC 2 is better than the monster’s Armor Class (4), the attack hits! Damage is rolled, and the result is subtracted from the monster’s current hit point total. Attack Rolls Using THAC0 (Optional Rule) # Instead of referring to the attack matrix, attacks may be resolved using THAC0 directly. A THAC0 score denotes the attack roll required to hit AC 0. The necessary attack roll to hit opponents of other AC scores can be calculated by subtracting the target AC from the THAC0. For example, a character with a THAC0 of 19 could hit an opponent with AC 5 on a roll of 14 or greater (19 - 5 = 14).\nNote: Using THAC0 to resolve attack rolls results in slightly different attack probabilities than the traditional approach of referring to the attack matrix.\nAttack Matrix # Attack Roll to Hit AC Monster HD THAC0 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NH 20 [-1] 20 20 20 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 Up to 1 19 [0] 20 20 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 1+ to 2 18 [+1] 20 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 2+ to 3 17 [+2] 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 3+ to 4 16 [+3] 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 4+ to 5 15 [+4] 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5+ to 6 14 [+5] 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 6+ to 7 13 [+6] 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 7+ to 9 12 [+7] 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 9+ to 11 11 [+8] 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 11+ to 13 10 [+9] 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 13+ to 15 9 [+10] 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 15+ to 17 8 [+11] 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 17+ to 19 7 [+12] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 19+ to 21 6 [+13] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 21+ or more 5 [+14] 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Monsters: Use the attack matrix row for their Hit Dice (see monster description).\nMonsters with bonus hit points: Monsters whose Hit Dice are notated as a number of dice plus a fixed hit point bonus (e.g., HD 2+1 — see Hit point modifiers under ***Game Statistics (Monsters) are more powerful and attack as if they were 1 HD higher. For example, a monster with 2 HD uses the THAC0 18 [+1] row, but a monster with 2+1 HD uses the THAC0 17 [+2] row.\nCharacters: Use the attack matrix row for their THAC0 score (see class description.\nNormal humans: Use the attack matrix row labeled NH.\nMonster Saving Throws # Hit Dice Death Wands Paralysis Breath Spells NH 14 15 16 17 18 1–3 12 13 14 15 16 4–6 10 11 12 13 14 7–9 8 9 10 10 12 10–12 6 7 8 8 10 13–15 4 5 6 5 8 16–18 2 3 4 3 6 19–21 2 2 2 2 4 22 or more 2 2 2 2 2 Monsters: Use the saving throw table row noted in the monster description.\nCharacters: Do not use this table.

Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Player Characters # Game Statistics: Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world. Creating a Character: To create a character, you\u0026rsquo;ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character. Ability Scores: A character\u0026rsquo;s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. Alignment: All beings, whether PCs, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies or spheres of behavior, known as alignments. Languages: The native languages a player character speaks are determined by the character\u0026rsquo;s class. Game Statistics # Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.\nAbility Scores # The fundamental physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of the character. There are six ability scores: Strength (abbreviated STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA). A character is ranked in each ability score by 3–18 (3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best).\nClass # An adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character’s class defines their primary abilities (see Character Classes).\nRace # A character may be human or one of several demihuman species. Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is considered human.\nLevel # Their experience level denotes the character’s experience as an adventurer. Characters typically start play at 1st level (the lowest level of adventurer) and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class.\nExperience Points (XP) # Accumulated experience points track the character’s advancement in the game. The referee awards experience points after a successful adventure. The character\u0026rsquo;s level increases when the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.\nPrime Requisite # The ability score (or scores) most important to the character’s class. The character’s score in these abilities can affect the rate at which the character accumulates experience points.\nAlignment # The character (and every other creature in the game world) is aligned with one of three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos (see Alignment). This alignment determines how certain magic influences the character and should be used by the player as a guideline for role-playing the character.\nHit Points (hp) # The character’s ability to avoid dying. The character has a maximum hit point total and a current hit point total, which are tracked separately. When a character is harmed, their current hit point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character is dead! Rest or healing can restore lost hit points (see Damage, Healing, and Death), but never above the character’s maximum hit point total (this is only increased when the character increases in level).\nHit Dice (HD) # The number of dice used to determine the character’s maximum hit point total. The character’s level determines the number of Hit Dice, and their class determines the type of dice rolled (i.e., d4, d6, d8). Some classes also grant a flat bonus to hit points at certain levels.\nArmor Class (AC) # The character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. AC is determined by the character’s armor and their Dexterity score. Lower Armor Class scores are better, so bonuses decrease the character’s AC, and penalties increase it.\nDual format: The equivalent ascending AC is listed in square brackets for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g., AC 5 [14] — an AC of 5 or 14 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\nUnarmored AC: An unarmored character has AC 9 [10].\nAscending AC (Optional Rule) # Some groups are more familiar with an Armor Class system where higher scores are better. This system is known as Ascending Armor Class (abbreviated AAC) and works as follows:\nArmor Class: When using AAC, higher scores are better. Bonuses to Armor Class increase the AAC score, and penalties decrease it. Attack rolls: When using AAC, the procedure for resolving attack rolls involves using an attack bonus instead of a THAC0 score and attack matrix. Note: Using Ascending Armor Class results in slightly different attack probabilities than using the traditional approach of descending AC with an attack matrix.\nAttack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0) # Their class and level determine the character’s ability to hit foes in combat. The THAC0 score indicates which row of the attack matrix (see Combat Tables) to use when attacking. Lower THAC0 scores are better.\nDual format: The equivalent attack bonus is listed in square brackets for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g., THAC0 15 [+4] — a THAC0 of 15, or an attack bonus of +4 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\nAttacking: The procedure for making attack rolls is described in Combat.\nSaving Throw Values # The character’s ability to avoid specific dangerous or detrimental effects. There are five saving throw categories: death (or poison), wands, paralysis (or petrification), breath attacks, and spells (or magic rods or staves). The character’s saving throw values are determined by class and level (see Saving Throws).\nMovement Rate # The speed at which the character can move when exploring, traveling, or during combat. Every character has a base movement rate and an encounter movement rate (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one-third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’ (40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and an encounter movement rate of 40’.\nOverland: The number of miles a character can travel in a day in the wilderness is determined by dividing their base movement rate by five. Exploration: When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn (10 minutes) Class Abilities # Finally, the character’s class denotes a set of special abilities that the character may use, including the ability to use certain types of armor and weapons and to speak one or more languages.\nCreating a Character # To create a character, you’ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.\nA selection of different character sheet PDFs is available at necroticgnome.com. These may be downloaded and printed for use in your games.\n1. Roll Ability Scores # Roll 3d6 in order of your character’s ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (see Ability Scores).\nSub-Par Characters # If you roll a character with abysmal ability scores—for example, an 8 or less in every score or a meager rating in more than one ability—the referee may allow you to discard the character and start again.\n2. Choose a Class # Select one of the classes available (see Character Classes), bearing in mind some classes\u0026rsquo; minimum ability score requirements. The chosen class determines your character’s race—unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is human.\n3. Adjust Ability Scores # If you wish, you may raise your character’s prime requisite of your character by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. One point may be added to a prime requisite for every two points by which an ability score is reduced. The following restrictions apply:\nOnly Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way. No score may be lowered below 9. Some character classes may have additional constraints. 4. Note Ability Score Modifiers # Now that your character’s ability scores are fixed, note any associated bonuses or penalties (see Ability Scores).\n5. Note Attack Values # The level progression chart for your character’s class lists your THAC0 score. This indicates your chance of hitting opponents in combat, as determined by the Attack Matrix.\nFor quick reference, it is convenient to look up the values in the attack matrix row corresponding to the character’s THAC0 (determined by class and level) and record them on your character sheet. 1st level characters have a THAC0 of 19 [0], resulting in the attack values below.\nAscending AC (Optional Rule) # If using the optional rule for Ascending AC, record your attack bonus on your character sheet, instead of the attack matrix quick reference.\nAttack Roll 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 AC Hit 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 6. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities # Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of their class, as well as your character’s saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which spells are recorded. The referee may allow you to choose.\n7. Roll Hit Points # Determine your character’s hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see Ability Scores). Your character always starts with at least 1 hit point, regardless of the CON modifier.\nRe-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule) # If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (before applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is to increase the survivability of 1st-level PCs.\n8. Choose Alignment # Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see Alignment), and note this on your character sheet.\n9. Note Known Languages # Your character’s native languages are listed in the class description. This includes the common tongue and the character’s alignment language—see Languages. Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages from the list available in the setting.\n10. Buy Equipment # Your character starts play with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces (see Wealth). You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under Equipment \u0026amp; Services.\nRemember: Your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g., weapons and armor).\n11. Note Armor Class # Two factors determine your character’s Armor Class:\nArmor: The armor worn determines your character’s base AC. See the equipment lists under Armor. Dexterity: A nimble character is more difficult to attack (see Dexterity under Ability Scores). Unarmored AC # If your character has no armor, their base AC is 9 [10].\n12. Note Level and XP # Your character begins play at 1st level with 0 XP.\n13. Name Character # Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!\nAbility Scores # A character’s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. The tables below list the modifiers associated with each ability score, with the effects described below.\nStrength (STR) # Brawn, muscle power, and physical might.\nMelee: This is applied to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons. Open doors: The chance of success with attempts to force open a stuck door (see Dungeon Adventuring).

All beings are categorized under three alignments: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos.\nLaw: The belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the universe. Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.\nNeutrality: The belief in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with neither side becoming dominant. Neutral beings will cooperate with others as long as it is not to their detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated and believe in living by their talents rather than relying on others.\nChaos: The belief in evil and the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe, wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. Chaotic beings lie and use others as is suitable to their own ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws, and are driven by whims and the belief in luck.\nRevealing Alignment # The player must inform the referee of their character’s alignment but does not have to tell other players.\nRole-Playing Alignment # Players should consider the chosen alignment when determining their character’s actions. The referee may call the player’s attention to deeds against the chosen alignment and suggest that the character changes to an alignment better fitting their behavior. Deviation from alignment may also be penalized as the referee sees fit.\nLanguages # The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the character’s class. These typically include the common tongue and an alignment language. Characters with high INT may learn additional languages (see Ability Scores).\nThe Common Tongue # The common tongue (sometimes simply called Common) is a language that is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.\nIn some settings, the referee may rule that different cultures in the campaign world have different languages, in which case a particular language must be chosen instead of Common.\nAlignment Languages # All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their alignment. This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognize when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten.\nOther Languages # Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own language, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence (at the referee’s discretion):\nd20 Language 1 Bugbear 2 Doppelgänger 3 Dragon 4 Dwarvish 5 Elvish 6 Gargoyle 7 Gnoll 8 Gnomish 9 Goblin 10 Halfling 11 Harpy 12 Hobgoblin 13 Kobold 14 Lizard man 15 Medusa 16 Minotaur 17 Ogre 18 Orcish 19 Pixie 20 Human dialect Advancement # Experience # All characters who survive an adventure and return to safety gain experience points (XP) due to any treasure recovered or monsters defeated. Experience points are awarded by the referee (see Awarding XP).\nPrime Requisite Modifiers # Characters with especially low or high scores in their class’ prime requisites receive a bonus or penalty for XP earned (see Ability Scores). These modifiers are applied to the total XP gained by each character following an adventure.\nLevel Up # When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player should consult the description of the character’s class and note any improvements in saving throws, attack probabilities, spells per day, and other class abilities. If the character’s Hit Dice increases, a new Hit Die of the specified type should be rolled, adding the result to the character’s maximum hit point total.\nMaximum XP in One Session # Characters can advance up to one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level is lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level.\nLevel Titles # In some campaigns, characters gain the right to bear specific titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of. Level titles often vary significantly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:\nCleric: Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess), Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Matriarch (Patriarch). Dwarf: Dwarven Veteran, Dwarven Warrior, Dwarven Swordmaster, Dwarven Hero, Dwarven Swashbuckler, Dwarven Myrmidon, Dwarven Champion, Dwarven Superhero, Dwarven Lord (Lady). Elf: Medium/Veteran, Seer/Warrior, Conjurer/Swordmaster, Magician/Hero, Enchanter (Enchantress)/Swashbuckler, Warlock (Witch)/Myrmidon, Sorcerer (Sorceress)/Champion, Necromancer/Superhero, Wizard/Lord (Lady). Fighter: Veteran, Warrior, Swordmaster, Hero, Swashbuckler, Myrmidon, Champion, Superhero, Lord (Lady). Halfling: Halfling Veteran, Halfling Warrior, Halfling Swordmaster, Halfling Hero, Halfling Swashbuckler, Halfling Myrmidon, Halfling Champion, Sheriff. Magic-user: Medium, Seer, Conjurer, Magician, Enchanter (Enchantress), Warlock (Witch), Sorcerer (Sorceress), Necromancer, Wizard. Thief: Apprentice, Footpad, Robber, Burglar, Cutpurse, Sharper, Pilferer, Thief, Master Thief. High-Level Play (Optional Rule) # Human character classes are listed as having a maximum level of 14. This range of levels presents the best play experience regarding challenge and reward. However, some groups may wish to continue playing at extremely high levels. This must be considered carefully, as demihuman PCs will be left behind due to their strict level limits. If the referee allows continued play into higher levels, the following guidelines—allowing human characters to advance to a maximum of 36th level—may be used.\nClerics # Clerics require an additional 100,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.\nFighters # Fighters require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Fighters of 20th level may make two attacks per round. This increases to three attacks per round at 25th level and four per round at 30th level.\nMagic-Users # Magic-users require an additional 150,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.\nThieves # Thieves require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Additional skills become available to high-level thieves, including the ability to climb upside down or horizontally, voice skills such as mimicry and ventriloquism, and other skills of deception.\nClass and Level Attack Roll to Hit AC Fighter Cleric, Thief Magic-User -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1–3 1–4 1–5 20 20 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 4–6 5–8 6–10 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7–9 9–12 11–15 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 10–12 13–16 16–20 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 13–15 17–20 21–25 13 13 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 16–18 21–24 26–30 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 19–21 25–28 31–35 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 22–24 29–32 36 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 25–27 33–36 — 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 28–30 — — 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 31–33 — — 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 34–36 — — 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Wealth # See Wealth.\nHirelings # See Hirelings.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/thievery/players-guide/classes/","title":"Classes: Thievery!

Clerics who fall out of favor with their deity may incur penalties.\nMagical research: A cleric of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to create new spells or other magical effects associated with their deity. When a cleric reaches 9th level, they can also create magic items.\nSpell casting: Once a cleric has proven their faith (from 2nd level), the character may pray to receive spells. The level progression table (below) shows the number of spells a cleric may memorize based on their experience level.

They can also use items that may only be used by divine spell casters (e.g., some magic staves).\nTurning the Undead # Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters encountered. To turn the undead, the player rolls 2d6. The referee then consults the table below, comparing the roll against the HD of the type of undead monsters targeted.\nSuccessful Turning # If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).\nTurned undead: Flee from the cleric’s presence if possible and will not harm the cleric.\nDestroyed undead (result of D): Are instantly and permanently annihilated.\nExcess: Rolled Hit Dice that are insufficient to affect a monster are wasted.\nMinimum effect: At least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.\nMixed groups: If turn undead is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.\nTurning the Undead # Hit Dice of Monster Type† Level 1 2 2* 3 4 5 6 7-9 1 7 9 11 — — — — — 2 T 7 9 11 — — — — 3 T T 7 9 11 — — — 4 D T T 7 9 11 — — 5 D D T T 7 9 11 — 6 D D D T T 7 9 11 7 D D D D T T 7 9 8 D D D D D T T 7 9 D D D D D D T T 10 D D D D D D D T 11+ D D D D D D D D * 2 HD monsters with a special ability (i.e., with an asterisk next to their HD rating in the monster description).\n† At the referee’s option, the table may be expanded to include more powerful types of undead monsters.\nTurning Table Results # —: The turning fails.\nNumber: The turning attempt succeeds if the 2d6 turning roll is higher or equal to the listed number.\nT: The turning succeeds.\nD: The turning succeeds; the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.\nAfter Reaching 9th Level # A cleric may construct a stronghold.

Referee's Guide","section":"Thievery! Referee's Guide","content":" Rules for Vehicles # Game Statistics # Hull Points (hp) # The vehicle’s structural integrity and ability to keep moving when damaged. Analogous to a character’s hit points. A vehicle that reaches 0 hull points is destroyed.\nArmor Class (AC) # The vehicle’s ability to resist damage from attacks.\nMovement Rate # The speed at which the vehicle can move. Every vehicle has a \u0026lsquo;base movement rate\u0026rsquo; and an \u0026lsquo;encounter movement rate\u0026rsquo; (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one-third of the base movement rate.\nCargo Capacity # The maximum load the vehicle can carry; measured in coins (see Time, Weight, Movement).\nRequired Crew # The number of people or animals (e.g., sailors, oarsmen, horses required for the vehicle’s normal operation.\nPassengers or Mercenaries # Some vehicles have extra space aboard explicitly intended to carry passengers or mercenaries of any type (see Mercenaries) and the normal crew. Suppose a vehicle’s description does not mention this space for passengers. In that case, it is assumed only to have space for the crew—the referee may rule that cargo hold space could be converted into additional living quarters.\nSeaworthiness # Water vessels are divided into two categories, each behaving differently under different wind conditions (see Wind Conditions). Seaworthy vessels are suitable for use on the high seas, away from coastal waters. Unseaworthy vessels are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.\nDamaging Vehicles # In combat, attacks and damage may be directed at vehicles, characters, and monsters.\nNormal attacks: Unless noted in a vehicle’s description, attacks with normal weapons (e.g., bows, swords, etc.) do not inflict hull damage.\nMagical attacks: Damaging spells or magical attacks inflict one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.\nGiant monsters: Can damage vehicles, inflicting one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit-point damage the attack does.\nMounted weaponry: Some vehicles carry mounted weaponry specifically designed for vehicle-to-vehicle combat. Such weapons inflict hull damage directly. The rules for attacking with ship-mounted weapons are described in Water Vessels.\nEffects of Hull Damage # When a vehicle loses hull points, its movement rate is also affected. This may be due to structural damage influencing how the vehicle moves or, in the case of water vessels, due to taking on water.\nMovement rate reduction: For every 10% a vehicle is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement rate is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if a vehicle loses 20% of its hull points, its movement rate is reduced by 20%.\nDestruction # If a vehicle is reduced to 0 hull points:\nIt will lose structural integrity in 1d10 rounds (e.g., a water vessel sinks). Any mounted weaponry is no longer functional. Repairs # In a workshop: Vehicle damage can be repaired by experienced technicians working in a suitable workshop or dock.\nIn the field: A vehicle’s crew can repair up to half of sustained damage. The remaining damage can only be repaired in a suitable workshop or dock.\nTime: It takes five crew members one turn to repair one hull point. This task requires full attention, so any crew involved in repair cannot take any other action during a turn repairing a vessel.\nBoarding # When the occupants of a vehicle wish to board another vehicle, the two vehicles must be brought alongside one another.\nForceful boarding: If the occupants of one vehicle wish to board the other vehicle forcefully, there is a 2-in-6 chance of successfully maneuvering the vehicle into a boarding position. The two vehicles may then be clamped together with grappling hooks.\nMutual boarding intent: If the occupants of both vehicles wish to board one another, their mutual goal makes the action succeed with no chance of failure.\nBoarding characters: Characters who are in the act of boarding another vehicle suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class for one round.\nRowed Water Vessels # Rowing Encounter Speeds # Some rowed vessels may have an increased encounter movement rate. This represents the tremendous effort of the oarsmen that may be exerted during combat. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods; thus, such vessels\u0026rsquo; per-turn and per-day movement rates are much slower.\nReduced Oarsmen # Having less than the required number of oarsmen reduces a vessel’s speed.\nMovement rate reduction: For every 10% reduction in the available rowing crew, the vessel’s rowing speed is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if 10% of the oarsmen are used to repair hull damage, the vessel moves at 90% of its normal speed (i.e., 10% slower than normal).\nLand Vehicles # Vehicle Cost (gp) Miles per Day Movement Rate Minimum Animals Max Load (Coins) Extra Animals Max Load (Coins) Cart 100 12 60’ (20’) 1 draft horse or 2 mules 4,000 2 draft horses or 4 mules 8,000 Wagon 200 12 60’ (20’) 2 draft horses or 4 mules 15,000 4 draft horses or 8 mules 25,000 Cart: A two-wheeled vehicle. Carts have an AC of 9 [10] and 1d4 hull points.\nWagon: A four-wheeled, open vehicle. Wagons have an AC of 9 [10] and 2d4 hull points.\nRequired Animals # These vehicles must be pulled by a minimum number of mules or draft horses. If double the minimum number of animals is employed, additional loads may be carried.\nDifficult Terrain # When traveling through difficult terrain (e.g. desert, forest, mountains, swamp), these vehicles can only travel on maintained roads.\nWater Vessels # Vessel Dimensions # A ship’s beam is its width, and its draft is the depth it extends beneath the water.\nHistorical Periods # The vessels described in this section span various historical periods, from the ancient period to the medieval. Not all types of vessels may be available in a campaign setting.\nSeaworthy Vessels # Vessel Cost (gp) Cargo Capacity (Coins) Usage Length Beam Draft Lifeboat 1,000 15,000 Any 20’ 4’–5’ 1’–2’ Longship 15,000 40,000 Any 60’–80’ 10’–15’ 2’–3’ Sailing ship (large) 20,000 300,000 Coastal waters, open seas 100’–150’ 25’–30’ 10’–12’ Sailing ship (small) 5,000 100,000 Coastal waters, open seas 60’–80’ 20’–30’ 5’–8’ Troop transport (large) 26,600 300,000 Coastal waters, open seas 100’–150’ 25’–30’ 10’–12’ Troop transport (small) 6,600 100,000 Coastal waters, open seas 60’–80’ 20’–30’ 5’–8’ Warship (large) 26,600 300,000 Coastal waters, open seas 100’–150’ 25’–30’ 10’–12’ Warship (small) 6,600 100,000 Coastal waters, open seas 60’–80’ 20’–30’ 5’–8’ Descriptions # Lifeboat: A small boat with a mast that folds down for storage. Small ships usually have 1–2 lifeboats, while larger ships may have 3–4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the ship\u0026rsquo;s cargo capacity on which it is carried by this much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with rations to feed ten human-sized beings for one week.\nLongship: A narrow ship that may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fills the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters as needed.\nSailing ship, large: A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually, it has multiple decks and raised “castles” at the bow and stern.\nSailing ship, small: A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.\nTroop transport (large, small): These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships but are specially designed to carry troops, mounts, and equipment of war as their cargo.\nWarship (large, small): These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships but are specially designed to carry mercenaries and war gear.\nUnseaworthy Vessels # Vessel Cost (gp) Cargo Capacity (Coins) Usage Length Beam Draft Boat (river) 4,000 30,000 Rivers, lakes 20’–30’ 10’ 2’–3’ Boat (sailing) 2,000 20,000 Lakes, coastal waters 20’–40’ 10’–15’ 2’–3’ Canoe 50 6,000 Rivers, swamps 15’ 3’ 1’ Galley (large) 30,000 40,000 Coastal waters 120’–150’ 15’–20’ 3’ Galley (small) 10,000 20,000 Coastal waters 60’–100’ 10’–15’ 2’–3’ Galley (war) 60,000 60,000 Coastal waters 120’–150’ 20’–30’ 4’–6’ Raft (makeshift) — 50 per square foot Rivers, lakes Varies Varies ½’ Raft (professional) 1gp per square foot 100 per square foot Rivers, lakes Varies Varies ½’ Descriptions # Boat, river: Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat increases by 1,000gp if it has a roof (to protect passengers or cargo).\nBoat, sailing: A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.\nCanoe: A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).\nGalley, large: A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.\nGalley, small: A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.\nGalley, war: A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet’s flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.\nRaft, makeshift: Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a maximum size of 20’ × 30’).\nRaft, professional: A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ × 40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).\nVessel Movement and Crew # Rowing (Oarsmen) Sailing (Sailors) Vessel Requires Captain?

The modification costs one-third of the ship’s original cost. Catapult: A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship. Ram: A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already has a ram fitted). Ship Weaponry # Item Cost (gp) Catapult 100 Catapult shot 5 Catapult shot, pitch 25 Ram, large galley 10,000 Ram, small galley 3,000 Rams # It can be used against ships or giant sea monsters. Small individuals cannot be targeted.\nAttack rolls: These are made using a THAC0 of 19 [0], occurring simultaneously in the combat sequence as missile fire.\nAttack modifiers: May be applied for weather conditions, maneuverability, etc.\nLarge or war galley: Deals 1d6+5 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.\nSmall galley: Deals 1d4+4 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.\nCatapults # Fire either large rocks or flaming pitch.\nWeight: A catapult plus twenty shot rounds weighs 10,000 coins (subtracted from the ship’s cargo allowance).\nRange: 150–300 yards.\nAttack rolls and rate of fire: Depend on the number of crew manning the catapult:\n2 crew (minimum): Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 10 rounds. 3 crew: Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 8 rounds. 4 crew (maximum): Attacks with THAC0 17 [+2]. Fires every 5 rounds. Attack modifiers: May be applied for weather conditions, maneuverability, etc.\nCatapult Shot # Inflicts 3d6 hull damage against ships.\nCatapult Shot, Pitch # Sets a 10’×10’ area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten in 2 turns, or fifteen in 1 turn.\nRetainers # Retainers are NPCs hired to accompany a character on adventures.\nLimit per PC: A character’s Charisma score defines the maximum number of retainers that will work for them at any one time (see Ability Scores).\nDuties: Retainers are expected to share the risks of adventuring with the party but will only continue working for a PC if treated well. A disgruntled retainer may spread the word to others in the area, making hiring other retainers more difficult for the PC.\nClass and Level # Retainers can be of any class (including normal humans—effectively of level 0), but must be of equal or lower level to the hiring PC.\nRecruitment # Potential retainers may be located by frequenting drinking establishments or by paying to post notices of help wanted.\nApplicants are recruited through negotiation, with the referee playing the roles of the NPCs a character attempts to hire. The PC should explain what the job entails and the wages paid.\nWages and Upkeep # The referee should determine the rate of pay desired by potential retainers, taking the following factors into account:\nSkill level: More experienced retainers will want a higher pay rate, whereas those employed for unskilled tasks will have lower demands. Competition: Retainers may accept lower pay rates if there are many applicants but may demand higher rates if there is little competition for the job. Standard Rate # Retainers usually want a guaranteed fee (per day or adventure) and a share of treasure recovered (at least a half share). For example: a cost of 1gp per day plus a half share of treasure.\nUpkeep # The hiring PC must also pay for the retainer’s daily upkeep (food and lodgings) and any new adventuring gear, weapons, or mounts the retainer requires.\nShares of Treasure # Fractional treasure shares are calculated by dividing the treasure by the total number of shares. For example, a party consisting of 5 PCs (who receive full shares) plus one retainer (who is paid a half share) discovers 2,750gp of treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five full shares plus one-half share): 500gp. Thus, each PC gains 500gp, and the retainer gains 250gp.\nApplicant Reactions # Once an offer is made, the referee determines the potential retainer’s reaction by rolling 2d6 on the table below, modified as follows:\nCharisma: The roll is modified by the hiring character’s NPC reactions modifier due to CHA (see ***Ability Scores. Generosity: The referee may apply a bonus or penalty, depending on the attractiveness of the deal (+1 or +2 for generous offers, -1 or -2 for poor offers). Reputation: A penalty of -1 or -2 may be applied if the hiring PC has a bad reputation. 2d6 Result 2 or less Ill will 3–5 Offer refused 6–8 Roll again 9–11 Offer accepted 12 or more Offer accepted, +1 loyalty Ill will: The applicant’s ill will incur a –1 penalty to further hiring reaction rolls made in the same settlement or area.\nExperience # Retainers gain experience and advance in level in the same way as PCs.\nXP penalty: Because retainers are generally not directly involved in decision-making, instead following instructions from PCs, the XP they receive is penalized by –50%.\nNormal humans: When a normal human (i.e., a retainer of level 0 with no character class) gains XP, they must choose an adventuring character class.\nLoyalty # A retainer’s loyalty rating reflects their willingness to stick by PCs in the face of danger. The hiring character’s CHA determines loyalty (see Ability Scores) but may be adjusted as follows:\nBonuses: Saving a retainer from danger or granting generous treasure rewards may increase loyalty. Penalties: Ill-treatment of a retainer or lack of treasure may decrease loyalty. Loyalty Checks # The referee should roll 2d6 against the retainer’s loyalty to make a loyalty check. The check succeeds if the roll is lower than or equal to the retainer’s loyalty.\nWhen to Check Loyalty # Loyalty checks are made in two circumstances:\nPeril: In situations of unexpectedly great danger. If the roll fails, the retainer will likely flee. After an adventure: If the roll fails, the retainer will not work for the PC again. Mercenaries # Hired soldiers who will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. Mercenaries do not accompany characters on adventures.\nNote that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.\nLocating Mercenaries # Mercenaries can be located by posting notices of help wanted. The response will depend on the availability of suitable troops in the area and the offer made.\nWages # Outside of wartime: As listed below.\nDuring wartime: All wages are doubled.\nUpkeep # The monthly rate of pay includes food and essential gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armor when hired, though their employer may give them additional equipment. Armorers are required to repair mercenaries’ armor and weapons (see Specialists).\nWage per Month Type AC Morale Human Dwarf Elf Orc Goblin Archer 6 [13] 8 5gp — 10gp 3gp 2gp Archer, mounted 9 [10] 9 15gp — 30gp — — Crossbowman 5 [14] 8 4gp 6gp — 2gp — Crossbowman, mounted 9 [10] 9 — 15gp — — — Footman, light 6 [13] 8 2gp — 4gp 1gp 5sp Footman, heavy 4 [15] 8 3gp 5gp 6gp 15sp — Horseman, light 7 [12] 9 10gp — 20gp — — Horseman, medium 5 [14] 9 15gp — — — — Horseman, heavy 3 [16] 9 20gp — — — — Longbowman 5 [14] 8 10gp — 20gp — — Peasant 9 [10] 6 1gp — — — — Wolf rider 7 [12] 9 — — — — 5gp Archer # Equipped with a shortbow, leather armor, and a shield.\nArcher, Mounted # Mounted on a riding horse.

Unlike retainers, there is no limit on the number of specialists a character may employ.\nThe most common types of specialists and their usual monthly wage are described. The referee may add new types of specialists as desired.\nLocating Specialists # Specialists can be located by posting notices or inquiring at suitable guilds. The response will depend on the availability of suitable specialists in the area and the offer made.\nWages and Upkeep # The monthly rate of pay includes food and essential gear.\nSpecialist Wage per Month Alchemist 1,000gp Animal trainer 500gp Armorer 100gp Assistant armorer 15gp Blacksmith 25gp Engineer 750gp Navigator 150gp Oarsman 2gp Sage 2,000gp Sailor 10gp Ship’s captain 250gp Spy 500gp (or more) Alchemist # Recreating potions: Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see Magical Research).\nResearching potions: An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.\nAnimal Trainer # Trainers are required for exotic creatures or larger numbers of common animals (e.g., dogs, horses, mules).\nSpecialty: Each animal trainer specializes in a single type of animal.\nNumber of animals: A trainer can work with up to 6 animals at a time.\nTime required: The referee decides the time required to train an animal, depending on the difficulty of the training and the animal’s intelligence. Learning the first new behavior or trick typically takes at least one month. Subsequent behaviors take at least two weeks each.\nInterruptions: Training of all desired behaviors must occur back to back. If interrupted, the animal becomes unable to learn further behaviors.\nArmorer # Producing weapons and armor: An armorer can produce five weapons, three shields, or one suit of armor per month.\nMaintaining mercenaries’ gear: A dedicated armorer is required per 50 troops.\nAssistants: An armorer’s output (either in arms produced or troops maintained) may be doubled by hiring two assistant armorers and one blacksmith. The armorer\u0026rsquo;s production may be quadrupled if four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired. An armorer cannot coordinate more assistants than this.\nAssistant Armorer # Apprentices who may work under an armorer to increase the production rate (see Armorer).\nBlacksmith # Craftsmen trained in the art of forging metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work under an armorer to increase the rate of production (see Armorer).\nEngineer # Engineers are experts in planning and managing construction projects, for example, building strongholds (see Construction).\nNumber required: One engineer is needed per 100,000 gp cost of the project.\nSpecialty: Certain races may have special expertise (e.g., a dwarf engineer may specialize in subterranean construction).\nNavigator # Experts in navigating the high seas. A ship that travels beyond sight of land becomes lost if a navigator is not aboard (see Waterborne Adventuring).\nOarsman # Normal humans employed to power rowed ships; not trained for combat.\nSage # Sages are very rare individuals who devote their lives to studying obscure knowledge. A sage may be consulted to answer unusual questions.\nTime and cost: The referee must judge the time and cost required to research the answer to a question.\nChance of success: There is never a 100% chance of finding an answer.\nSailor # Normal humans trained in the handling of sailing ships. Sailors can fight to defend their ships, typically equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armor.\nShip’s Captain # A seasoned sailor required to command a larger ship. A captain is familiar with the waters around the coasts they frequent.\nSpy # A spy is hired to gather information about a person or group. The spy may be an outsider trying to infiltrate or a traitor already connected with the person or group to be spied upon.\nClass: Spies are often NPC thieves but may be of any character class.\nTime: The referee will determine the time required for the job.\nChance of success: Based on the circumstances, the referee judges the chance of the mission succeeding.\nReliability: The referee may also secretly decide a chance of the spy betraying the character.\nStrongholds # Construction # When PCs wish to construct strongholds or any other type of building, the following procedure should be used:\nPermission: It may be necessary to secure permission to build from an existing authority over the land. This may not be required if the land is uncharted wilderness. Clear land: If the construction site is in the wilderness, all monsters in a 6-mile area (i.e., one hex on a typical small-scale wilderness map) must be killed or driven off. Design: The player creates a plan for the stronghold and calculates the costs (see construction prices in Structures. Review: The referee should review and approve the player’s plans. Hire engineers: For every 100,000gp cost of the stronghold, the PC must hire one engineer (see Specialists). Construction: Construction may commence once the land has been cleared and construction materials delivered. The time required depends entirely on the stronghold’s total price: one day of game time per 500 gp. Prepare for settlers: If the PC wishes to find a dominion and attract settlers, a wider area around the stronghold should be cleared of dangers. Building in Towns # Permission: While local rulers may allow PCs to build in a town, it is unlikely that they will grant permission to construct castles or fortifications.\nCosts: When building in an existing town or city, the proximity of materials and labor dramatically reduces the costs.\nStone buildings: Reduced by 60%.\nWooden buildings: Reduced by 80%.\nDomain Management # Maintaining Cleared Lands # Mercenaries may be hired to conduct patrols to prevent monsters from returning to cleared lands. These patrols can cover a maximum radius of 18 miles around a stronghold (6 miles in inhospitable terrain such as swamps, mountains, or thick jungle). If the area to be maintained is larger, additional garrisons must be stationed at intervals.\nSettlers # The PC may wish to attract settlers into a cleared area. In addition to ensuring the safety of surrounding lands, the character will have to fund the construction of other buildings (e.g., accommodation, commercial facilities, transport infrastructure, etc.) to attract settlers. Advertising may also be necessary. The referee will determine the costs involved and how many settlers are attracted.\nTaxation # If settlers move into the PC’s domain, the character can expect to gain 10 gp of taxes per year from each settler.\nStructures # Structure Cost Barbican 37,000 gp Bastion 9,000 gp Civilian building, stone 3,000 gp Civilian building, wood 1,500 gp Drawbridge 500 gp Gatehouse 6,500 gp Keep 75,000 gp Moat 400 gp Subterranean passage 500 gp Tower, large 30,000 gp Tower, small 15,000 gp Wall, castle 5,000 gp Descriptions # Barbican: Heavily fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall: two small towers, a gatehouse, and a drawbridge.\nBastion: Semi-circular tower built against a castle wall. 30’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.\nCivilian building, stone: Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. The outer wall is 120’ long (e.g., 30’×30’), walls 1–2’ thick.\nCivilian building, wood: Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic. The outer wall is 120’ long (e.g., 30’×30’).\nDrawbridge: Raisable wooden bridge crossing a moat. It may be attached to a gatehouse. 10’ long.\nGatehouse: Fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall. Includes a portcullis. 30’×30’ base, 20’ high, walls 5’ thick.\nKeep: Fortified, central building of a castle. 60’ square, 80’ high, walls 10’ thick.\nMoat: Defensive ditch, often filled with water. 100’ long, 20’ wide, 10’ deep.\nSubterranean passage: Typical 10’×10’×10’ dungeon passageway.\nTower, large: Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. 30’ base, 40’ high, walls 5’ thick.\nTower, small: Round tower, either freestanding or built into a castle wall. 20’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.\nWall, castle: A stone wall with battlements. 100’ long, 20’ high, 10’ thick.\nNon-Standard Dimensions # Bastions # Bastions of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. Use the guidelines for towers, below, and divide by two.\nCastle Walls # Higher castle walls may be constructed at an increased cost. A 100’ length of 30’ high wall costs 7,500 gp. Every additional 10’ height beyond this (up to a maximum of 60’ tall) costs 5,000 gp.\nTowers # Towers of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. The cost is determined by the tower\u0026rsquo;s height and its base\u0026rsquo;s diameter (in feet).\nMaximum height: Twice the base diameter. Up to the base diameter: Each 10’ height costs 200 gp × the base diameter. Above the base diameter: Each 10’ height costs 400 gp × the base diameter. Example Tower Cost Calculation # A 60’ high tower with a 40’ diameter base will be constructed.\nThe cost will be 8,000 gp (40 × 200 gp) per 10’ for the first 40’ of height and 16,000 gp (40 × 400 gp) per 10’ for the remainder of the height.\nThe total cost is thus (8,000 gp × 4) + (16,000 gp × 2) = 64,000 gp.\nInterior Features # The common interior features of a stronghold are listed in the table below.\nSimple Approach # For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold may be increased by 25% to account for interior details, including: reinforced doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring, tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars and shutters on windows, and standard furnishings.\nDetailed Approach # The table below may be consulted if the group wishes to perform more detailed calculations or if additional features are desired.\nDetail Dimensions Cost (gp) Arrow slit — 10 Door, iron 3’ wide, 7’ tall 50 Door, reinforced wood 3’ wide, 7’ tall 20 Door, stone 3’ wide, 7’ tall 50 Door, wood 3’ wide, 7’ tall 10 Floor, flagstones or tiles 10’×10’ section 100 Floor, wood 10’×10’ section 40 Roof, tiled 10’×10’ section 100 Roof, wood 10’×10’ section 40 Secret door or trapdoor Normal 5 × normal Shifting wall 10’×10’ section 1,000 Stairs, stone 3’ wide, 10’ long section 60 Stairs, wooden 3’ wide, 10’ long section 20 Trapdoor, iron 4’×3’ 120 Trapdoor, reinforced wood 4’×3’ 40 Trapdoor, stone 4’×3’ 120 Trapdoor, wood 4’×3’ 20 Window — 10 Window bars — 10 Window shutters — 5 "},{"id":7,"href":"/thievery/players-guide/magic/","title":"Magic: Thievery! Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Rules of Magic # Some character classes can memorize and cast magical spells. A spell consists of a pattern of magical energy memorized in a character’s mind. When a spell is cast, the spell is erased from the character’s mind until it is memorized again.\nArcane and divine magic: Spells are either granted by a deity or higher power (divine magic) or learned by esoteric study (arcane magic).\nSpell list: The character’s class determines which spells they can cast. Each class has an associated list of spells.\nSpells in memory: The character’s level determines how many spells they can memorize at one time.\nReversible spells: As indicated in each spell’s description, some spells are reversible.\nMemorizing Spells # Rest and time requirements: A spellcaster can memorize new spells after an uninterrupted night’s sleep. It takes one hour to memorize all the spells the character is capable of.\nDuplicate spells: A character may memorize the same spell more than once if they can learn more than one spell of the given level.\nCasting Spells # A memorized spell may be cast by precisely replicating the required hand gestures and mystical spoken words.\nOnce only: When a spell is cast, knowledge of the spell is erased from the caster\u0026rsquo;s mind until it is memorized again.\nFreedom: The character must be able to speak and move their hands. A spellcaster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.\nLine of sight: Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of effect) must be visible to the caster.\nSpell Effects # Selecting targets: Some spells affect multiple targets by area or Hit Dice total. If the spell description does not specify how targets are chosen, the referee must decide whether they are selected randomly, by the caster, etc.\nConcentration: Some spells specify that the caster must concentrate to maintain the magical effect. Unless the spell description states otherwise, performing any other action or being distracted (e.g., attacked) causes concentration to end.\nCumulative effects: Multiple spells cannot increase the same ability (e.g., bonuses to attack rolls, AC, damage rolls, saving throws, etc.). Spells that affect different abilities can be combined. Spells can be combined with the effects of magical items.\nArcane Magic # Memorizing Spells # Arcane spell casters memorize spells from spell books (see Spell Books) and are thus limited to choosing from the spells in their spell book, which must be at hand.\nReversing Spells # A spell\u0026rsquo;s normal or reversed form must be selected when memorized. An arcane spellcaster may memorize both forms of a spell if the character can memorize more than one spell of the given level.\nDivine Magic # Memorizing Spells # Divine spell casters memorize spells through prayer to their gods. When praying for spells, divine spell casters may choose any spells in their class’ spell list that they are of high enough level to cast.\nReversing Spells # Divine spell casters can cast the reversed version of a spell by speaking the words and performing the gestures backward when cast.\nDeity Disfavour # Divine spell casters must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and religion. If the character ever falls from favor with their deity, penalties (determined by the referee) may be imposed. These may include penalties to attack (-1), a reduction in spells, or being sent on a perilous quest. To regain favor, the character must perform some great deed for their deity (as determined by the referee), for example, donating magic items or gold, constructing a temple, converting many people to the religion, defeating a powerful enemy of the deity, etc.\nSpells and Deity Alignment # A divine spellcaster may draw disfavor from their deity when casting spells (or their reversed versions) whose effects go against the deity’s alignment:\nLawful characters: Will only use reversed spells in dire circumstances. Chaotic characters: Will usually use reversed spells, only using the normal versions of spells to benefit allies of their religion. Neutral characters: Will favor either normal or reversed spells, depending on the deity served (no deity favors both reversed and normal spells). Note: Entry included from Spells.\nSpell Books # Arcane spell casters record the spells that they know in a spell book.\nNumber of spells: A character’s spell book contains exactly the number of spells the character can memorize (as determined by the character’s class and level).\nBeginning Spells # Arcane spell casters begin with as many spells in their spell book as they can memorize. The referee may choose these spells or may allow the player to select them.\nAdding Spells # When the number of spells an arcane spellcaster can memorize increases (e.g., by gaining an experience level), they can increase the selection of spells in their spell book. In this way, the number of spells in the spell book may be brought in line with the number of spells the character can memorize. This is possible in two ways:\nMentoring: The character may consult an arcane guild or mentor to learn new spells. This process takes about a week of game time. The spells a character learns in this way are determined by the referee, who may decide to let the player choose. Research: It is also possible to add spells to a spell book using Magical Research. Lost Spell Books # An arcane spellcaster can rewrite the spells in a lost or destroyed spell book:\nCost: The cost per spell to be recovered is one week of game time and 1,000gp per spell level. For instance, rewriting two 1st-level and one 2nd-level spells will take four weeks and 4,000 gp. Sole activity: This activity requires complete concentration. The character may not engage in any other activity for the required period. Captured Spell Books # Each arcane spell caster’s spell books are written so that only the owner can read the spells without magic.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/thievery/referees-guide/magic/","title":"Magic: Thievery! Referee's Guide","section":"Thievery! Referee's Guide","content":" Magical Research # Many spell-casting character classes can also perform research into new spells, magic items, and other magical effects, as noted in the class description. This requires time, monetary outlay, and sometimes rare and unusual ingredients.\nChance of Failure # All forms of magical research have a minimum 15% chance of failure. If the research fails, the money and time invested are lost.\nCreating New Spells # The player must write up the spell they wish to create and show the referee. The referee then decides what level the spell will be and may request changes (or deem the magic impossible to research).\nRestrictions # The character can only research spells of a level they can cast.\nCost and Time # Researching a new spell takes two weeks per spell level and 1,000 gp per spell level.\nCreating Magic Items # The player must write up the item they wish to create and show the referee. The referee then decides what materials are required and may request changes (or deem the item impossible to research).\nRestrictions # Divine spell casters: May only create items they can use themselves.\nArcane spell casters: May create any item except those that may only be used by divine spell casters.\nMaterials # Creating magic items often requires rare components such as expensive gems or body parts of monsters or rare animals. Often, adventures will be necessary to acquire these materials.\nCost and Time # Duplicating spell effects: Single-use items (e.g., scrolls, potions) that recreate the effects of a spell cost one week per spell level and 500gp per spell level.\nMulti-use items: If the item created can replicate a spell effect multiple times (for example, a wand with charges), the cost in time and money is multiplied by the number of uses.\nOther items: The referee must judge the requirements for creating items that do not recreate the effects of a spell. More powerful items should require more time, money, and special materials or quests. Some examples: 20 arrows +1 (10,000 gp, one month), plate mail +1 (10,000 gp, six months), crystal ball (30,000 gp, six months), ring of x-ray vision (100,000 gp, one year).\nOther Magical Research # Characters who can research spells or magic items may also attempt to research other magical processes. For example, a character may wish to sanctify a holy site or create magical traps, constructs, or portals.\nAs with magic item creation, the referee decides the time and cost of the research. The following may also be required:\nThe casting of certain, specific spells. Rare ingredients. Sometimes, it may also be necessary to repeat the ritual to renew the magical effect periodically.

Monsters with a hit point modifier are treated specially by some spells.\nFractional Hit Dice: Some monsters are listed as having less than one HD, either as ½ (roll 1d4) or as a fixed number of hp.\nAverage hit points: The average hit point value is listed in parentheses.\nAttacks Usable Per Round (Att) # The attacks the monster can use each round, with the damage inflicted in parentheses. (Note that unless specified, the monsters’ attack and damage rolls are not modified by STR or DEX.)\nAlternative attack routines: Are noted with “or” or square brackets.\nSaving Throw Values (SV) # The monster’s saving throw values:\nD: Death/poison. W: Wands. P: Paralysis/petrification. B: Breath attacks. S: Spells/rods/staves. Save as HD: The HD at which the monster saves is listed in parentheses (with NH indicating that it saves as a normal human). This is usually the monster’s HD rating, but sometimes differs:\nUnintelligent monsters: Typically save at half their HD rating. Magical monsters: They may save at a higher HD rating. Character classes: Some monsters save as a character class. In this case, the class and level are listed. Attack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0) # The monster’s ability to hit foes in combat is determined by its Hit Dice (see the Attack Matrix table under Combat Tables).\nAttack bonus: The monster’s attack bonus (required when using the optional rule for Ascending AC) is listed afterward in square brackets.\nMovement Rate (MV) # The speed at which the monster can move. Every monster has a base movement rate and an encounter movement rate (noted in parentheses, one-third of the base movement rate).\nModes of movement: If the monster has multiple modes of movement (e.g., walking, flying, climbing), they are listed individually, separated by slashes.\nMorale Rating (ML) # The monster’s likelihood to persist in battle.

If the second value is a zero, monsters of this type are not usually encountered in the wilderness and do not usually have lairs.\nUsage: The use of these values depends on the situation in which monsters are encountered:\nWandering monsters in a dungeon: The first value determines the number of monsters encountered roaming in a dungeon level equal to their HD. If the monster is encountered on a level greater than its HD, the number appearing may be increased; if encountered on a level less than its HD, the number appearing should be reduced. Monster lair in a dungeon: The second value lists the number of monsters found in a lair in a dungeon. Wandering monsters in the wilderness: The second value indicates the number of monsters encountered roaming in the wilderness. Monster lair in the wilderness: The second value multiplied by 5 indicates the number of monsters found in a lair in the wilderness.

P to V: If listed for an intelligent monster, indicate treasure carried by individuals (P to T) or a group (U, V). If listed as an unintelligent monster, indicate treasure from the bodies of its victims. General Notes # Infravision # All non-human monsters have infravision (see Darkness under Hazards and Challenges). Unless specified in a monster’s description, this allows monsters to see up to 60’ in the dark.\nLanguages # 20% of intelligent monsters speak Common (see Languages) unless the monster description states otherwise. Many intelligent monster species also have their tongue.\nPersons # Some spells or magical effects only affect creatures classified as “persons.” This includes all humans, demihumans, and human-like monsters of up to 4+1 HD.

This procedure generates parties of NPC adventurers. As the process is fairly involved, referees may wish to pre-generate some NPC parties for use in random encounters. The following general details apply to all types of NPC parties described:\nSpells: If spell casters are present, choose or roll their memorized spells. Equipment: Normal adventuring gear. Treasure: Treasure types U + V, shared among the group. Marching order: Decided by the referee. If the classes presented in this document are not used, the referee should replace the listed classes with equivalents in the campaign.\nBasic Adventurers # Composition: 1d4+4 characters of random class and level (see below). Alignment: Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party. Expert Adventurers # Composition: 1d6+3 characters of random class and level (see below). Alignment: Either roll the alignment of each NPC or roll once for the party. Mounts: 75% chance of being mounted, in the wilderness. Magic items: Per individual: there is a chance of the NPC having a magic item from each suitable magic item sub-table (see Magic Items). The chance per sub-table is 5% per level of the NPC. Rolled items that the NPC cannot use should be ignored (no re-roll). High-Level Cleric # A high-level cleric and party (Mounts and Magic Items as per Expert Adventurers.\nComposition: Leader (cleric of level 1d6+6), 1d4 clerics (level 1d4+1), 1d3 fighters (level 1d6). Alignment: Roll for the whole party. High-Level Fighter # A high-level fighter and a group of retainers, often on their way to or from war (Mounts and Magic Items as per Expert Adventurers.\nComposition: Leader (fighter of level 1d4+6), 2d4 retainers (level 1d4+2, any class). Alignment: Roll for the whole party. High-Level Magic-User # A high-level magic-user, accompanied by their apprentices and a group of hired guards, often on a quest for arcane lore (Mounts and Magic Items as per Expert Adventurers.\nComposition: Leader (magic-user of level 1d4+6), 1d4 apprentices (magic-users of level 1d3), 1d4 mercenaries (fighters of level 1d4+1). Alignment: Roll the leader’s alignment. The apprentices have the same alignment as the leader, but the mercenaries may be of different alignment. NPC Adventurer Class and Level # Level d8 Class Basic Expert 1 Cleric 1d3 1d6+3 2 Dwarf 1d3 1d6+6 3 Elf 1d3 1d6+2 4 Fighter 1d3 1d6+3 5 Fighter 1d3 1d6+5 6 Halfling 1d3 1d6+2 7 Magic-User 1d3 1d6+3 8 Thief 1d3 1d6+4 NPC Adventurer Alignment # d6 Alignment 1–2 Lawful 3–4 Neutral 5–6 Chaotic Stronghold Encounters # When PCs wander into the vicinity of the wilderness stronghold of a high-level NPC, a warm reception is only sometimes guaranteed. These guidelines may be used if the referee does not have specific notes on a stronghold’s ruler and guard patrols.\nRuler # The referee should decide what class of NPC claims ownership of the stronghold and the surrounding lands:\nCleric: Of level 1d8+6. Fighter: Of level 1d6+8. Magic-user: Of level 1d4+10. Demihuman strongholds are unusual cases and should be detailed in advance by the referee. Typically, they will attempt to avoid all contact with travelers.\nPatrols # Strangers in the lands around a stronghold will typically be spotted by mercenary groups hired to patrol the lands. The type of troops depends on the ruler’s class:\nCleric: 2d6 medium horsemen. Equipped with chainmail (AC 5 [14]) and lances. Morale 9. Fighter: 2d6 heavy horsemen. Equipped with plate mail (AC 3 [16]), lances, and swords. Morale 9. Magic-user: 2d6 heavy footmen. Equipped with chainmail + shield (AC 4 [15]) and swords. Morale 8. Garrison # Patrols like those described are only a small part of the ruler’s garrison. Further forces may include magical monsters or humans mounted on flying creatures.\nReaction to Travellers # The reaction of the ruler to travelers in their domain depends on the class of the ruler and can be determined by rolling 1d6 and consulting this table:\nd6 Cleric Fighter Magic-User 1 Chase Chase Chase 2 Chase Chase Ignore 3 Ignore Chase Ignore 4 Ignore Ignore Ignore 5 Invite Ignore Ignore 6 Invite Invite Invite Chase: The patrol is instructed to chase intruders out of the domain. Alternatively, they may demand a toll from travelers passing through. The price demanded depends on the ruler’s character, the apparent wealth of the PCs, etc. If the PCs refuse to pay the toll, the patrol may attack them, drive them away, or attempt to take them prisoner.\nIgnore: The patrol leaves the PCs to go about their business.\nInvite: The patrol brings a message from the domain’s ruler, inviting the PCs to stay in the stronghold. The ruler’s motive for doing so will depend on their personality—it is not necessarily benign.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/thievery/referees-guide/running-adventures/","title":"Running Adventures: Thievery! Referee's Guide","section":"Thievery! Referee's Guide","content":" The Referee’s Role # Facilitator of Fun and Adventure # The referee should bring to life exciting adventures for the group\u0026rsquo;s enjoyment.\nPreparation: Before the game begins, the adventure should be planned and the required maps drawn. Advice on adventure design is found in Adventure Scenarios, Designing a Dungeon, Designing a Wilderness, and Designing a Base Town.\nImprovisation: Despite the referee’s preparation, predicting every possible player action is impossible. Players will come up with ideas that the referee has not even considered. Thus, the referee must remain flexible and roll with any unexpected turns the adventure might take!\nProcedures: The game’s rules provide guidelines for many common adventuring situations. These exist to aid the referee in running the game. However, the referee should feel free to adapt and add to these procedures during play to keep the game moving.\nBalance: The referee must maintain a fun balance of risk and reward.\nNeutral Judge # The referee must remain neutral in all things—neither on the side of the players nor against them.\nNon-competitive: The game is not a competition, with the players attempting to defeat the referee or vice versa.\nFairness: The game\u0026rsquo;s rules should be applied equally to player characters, monsters, and NPCs.\nArbiter of Rules # The referee must decide when and how to apply the game rules.\nRulings: The rules of the game—including descriptions of magic items, spells, or monsters’ special abilities—do not cover all possible scenarios, so the referee must be ready to apply judgment to resolve any unexpected situations that arise.\nResolving actions: When a player wishes to do something not covered by a standard rule, the referee must consider how to determine the outcome. Sometimes, the situation can be dealt with by deciding what would happen. Sometimes, the referee may require the player to make an ability check (see Ability Checks) or a saving throw (see Saving Throws) to determine what happens. Other times, the referee may judge the likelihood of the action succeeding (e.g., expressed as a percentage or X-in-6 chance), tell the player the chances, and let them decide whether to take the risk.\nDisagreements: The players may not always agree with the referee’s application of the game\u0026rsquo;s rules. When this happens, the group should (briefly!) discuss the point of disagreement and come to a decision. In such cases, the referee is always the final arbiter and should ensure the game does not get bogged down in lengthy discussions about the rules.\nRandomness: The referee should make judicious use of die rolls, random tables, etc. While these can add fun and unpredictability to the game, overuse of randomness can spoil an adventure by derailing it too much.\nHandling PCs # Rate of Advancement # Each group will have preferences regarding how quickly player characters gain experience points and increase in level.\nStandard: After three to four sessions, it is normal for at least one PC to have reached 2nd level. If this has not happened, the referee may wish to increase the amount of treasure. If, on the other hand, most PCs have reached 3rd level in this time frame, the referee might place less treasure or make monsters more challenging.\nFast: The referee should place large treasure hoards for groups who prefer a game where characters advance quickly. These should, however, be guarded by appropriately challenging monsters.\nSlow: For groups who prefer the game to focus on character development rather than high risk, the rate of advancement and the danger presented by monsters may be reduced.\nCharacter Knowledge # Attention must be paid to the distinction between what a player knows and what their PC knows. Players may sometimes act on information that their PC could not know. The referee may occasionally need to remind players of this and even forbid specific actions.\nGrudges # Player characters may, through the course of play, naturally develop grudges or rivalries. This is especially true when characters of opposite alignments adventure together. This is a natural and fun part of good role-playing. However, the referee should ensure that such grudges do not dominate play and spoil the adventure for others.\nMaintaining Challenge # The referee must keep the game challenging, even when player characters have reached high levels and amassed great wealth and power.\nMagical research: Spell-casting characters may attempt to create new spells and magic items. When this happens, the referee should pay meticulous attention to game balance. Permanent magic, which may be used without limit, does not allow a saving throw, or increases in power with level can quickly become imbalanced. If in doubt, one option is to allow a new spell or item to be tested for a period, under the proviso that it may need to be altered if it proves to imbalance play.\nSpecial abilities: Players may sometimes try to find ways to gain special abilities and powers beyond their characters’ normal class abilities. The referee should be careful when allowing this, as it can lead to imbalance. The guidelines for magical research above should be used.\nExcess wealth: If the level of PC wealth has gotten out of hand, the referee may wish to find ways to take extra money away from the characters. This should always be done in such a way as to present the player with a choice, for example, pay a local tax or become an outlaw.\nRunning the Game # Describing the Unknown # When describing what player characters experience during an adventure, the referee should be careful to keep an air of mystery. The best way to achieve this is to describe what characters see, hear, smell, and so on without providing additional information to the players.\nMonsters: Should be described rather than referred to by name. Players will recognize different types of monsters by their descriptions and behaviors.\nSurprise attacks: When characters are attacked by surprise, the referee should describe the attack itself rather than giving players the complete description of the attacking monster. For example, a character may see a clawed hand reaching out of the shadows. Only in subsequent combat rounds should a more detailed description of the monster be provided.\nMonster and NPC game stats: The game statistics (e.g., hit points, level) of monsters and NPCs should never be revealed to players. In combat, the referee should describe the effects of damage on a monster rather than telling the players how many hit points it has remaining.\nMagic items: Should be described rather than referred to by name. Only by experimentation can players discover what powers a magic item has and whether an item is magical!\nDescribing Explored Areas # The usual procedure is for the players to draw maps of explored areas based on the referee’s descriptions.\nSquares: One way to speed up mapping is to specify dimensions (e.g., the width and length of rooms in a dungeon) in terms of map squares rather than feet. Of course, the referee and the players must agree on the size of one map square.\nKnown areas: Sometimes, characters may already know the shape of an explored area. In this case, the referee may draw the parts of the map which are already known.\nComplex areas: In the case of highly complicated areas, the referee may draw directly on the players’ map. This is not generally to be encouraged, however, as it does not help the players improve their mapping skills.\nUsing Miniatures # Some groups like using miniatures and a gridded tabletop surface to track exploration and combat.\nPlay surface: The most convenient surface type is something maps can be drawn with erasable pens. The surface should be gridded for ease of tracking the movements of characters.\nScale: The typical scale used is 1” on the playing surface = 5’ in the game world (or 5 yards for outdoor encounters).\nMiniatures: Miniature figures are available to purchase from many different companies. Alternatively, simple tokens like dice or beads can be used.\nMonsters and NPCs # The referee is responsible for deciding how monsters and NPCs react when encountered and what schemes and tactics they follow when the PCs are elsewhere.\nIntelligence and Tactics # When deciding how a monster or NPC acts, the referee should bear its level of intelligence in mind. Intelligent monsters might use any of the following tactics.\nTraps and stealth: Monsters who are cunning but not physically powerful might lay traps or ambushes and may favor attacking PCs from a distance with missile weapons.\nGuards: Monsters may use guards or pets to weaken PCs or protect important escape routes.\nMagic items: Monsters will use any magic items in their lair to thwart the PCs.\nLearning and preparation: If PCs encounter but do not defeat monsters, the monsters will learn from the experience and prepare for a repeat attack. They may build defensive structures, call for reinforcements, relocate their base of operations, and so on.\nAdaptation: Monsters may copy or adapt tactics successfully used by PCs and plan specific counter-moves.\nTeamwork # When designing encounters, the referee should remember that—like player characters—monsters and NPCs will join forces to increase their chance of survival.\nCombined forces: Monsters skilled in melee, missile attacks, and magic may join forces.\nLeaders: May have special abilities, maximum hit points, or additional Hit Dice.\nMotivation # The same as player characters, intelligent monsters and NPCs have their interests and motivations.\nRole-playing: The referee should consider the monster’s reaction to negotiations with PCs, considering its alignment and personality. Monsters should not always cooperate with PCs’ wishes!\nAllies: Monsters and NPCs may be encountered with friends, minions, or retainers. These will come to the aid of the monster or may avenge it if it is defeated.\nAdventure Scenarios # The first step in designing an adventure of any kind is to decide on the type of scenario. This hook draws the player characters to the adventure site and provides a background theme for the referee to tie the location together. The scenario drives the referee’s choices of specific traps, treasures, and monsters to be placed in the area. The following examples may be used for inspiration.\n1. Banishing Ancient Evil # An evil presence (e.g., a monster or NPC) must be banished or destroyed. It may have been dormant for many years and only recently awakened (perhaps due to another party’s meddling).\n2. Clearing Ruins # Settlers plan to move into an abandoned settlement or stronghold. Before they arrive, the PCs must scout the area and clear out any monsters or other dangers. The ruins need not be remote—they could even be within (or beneath) a significant settlement.\n3. Contacting a Lost Civilisation # The PCs discover a long-lost race in a fantastic location. They may have once been human but now adapt to their strange environment. For example, they may have reverted to bestial behavior or may be adapted to subterranean life, with pale skin and infravision.\n4. Escaping from Captivity # An enemy has taken the PCs prisoner, and they begin the adventure in captivity, possibly with a horrible fate awaiting them shortly. They must regain their freedom.\n5. Exploring Unknown Territory # An NPC hires the party to explore and map an unknown region. This may be a previously uncharted area or a recent alteration to a familiar territory (e.g., a magic castle may appear in an empty plain).\n6. Performing a Quest # A deity or powerful NPC (e.g., a king) sends the PCs on a quest. This may involve recovering holy or magical items.\n7. Rescuing Captives # Bandits, wicked monsters, or an evil wizard have kidnapped important NPCs. The PCs attempt to rescue the prisoners, either seeking a reward or because of a personal connection with the unfortunate captives. The PCs may also be hired as bodyguards to NPCs negotiating with the kidnappers.\n8. Scouting an Enemy Outpost # An invasion is looming (or in progress)! The PCs are tasked with infiltrating an enemy outpost, gathering intelligence on their plans, strengths, and weaknesses, and (if possible) destroying them.\n9. Seeking a Magical Doorway # A gateway allows magical travel (either one-way or bidirectional) between distant locations or other worlds. The PCs may be tasked with locating a lost portal or closing a portal used by enemies. The portal may also be the only means of travel to a fantastic destination the PCs must visit.\n10. Visiting a Sacred Site # To consult with an oracle, remove a curse, or find a holy relic, the PCs must journey to a sacred site (e.g., a shrine or temple). The exact location of the site is usually a matter of conjecture.\nDesigning a Dungeon # 1. Choose the Setting # Decide on the basic form and structure of the dungeon (the table below may be used) and begin to consider ideas for the main rooms or areas.\nd6 Setting 1 Crypt or tomb complex 2 Natural caverns 3 Settlement (e.g., stronghold, city) 4 Subterranean delving (e.g. mine) 5 Temple 6 Tower or fortification 2. Choose Monsters # Based on the selected adventure scenario and dungeon setting, decide what types of monsters inhabit the dungeon, choosing from any available monster books, creating new monsters specially for the dungeon, or tailoring standard monsters to the location.\n3. Map the Dungeon # Overall shape: The dungeon setting will determine the structure of the rooms and connecting passages (e.g., rough cavern walls, carefully laid-out defensive structures, etc.).\nMapping scale: Typically, dungeon maps are drawn on graph paper with a 10’ per square scale. (Larger or smaller scales may be used as appropriate.)\nNumbering: Give each area (e.g., room or cave) of the dungeon a number so that the location on the map can easily be cross-referenced with the description of its contents (see step 4).\n4. Stock the Dungeon # Make notes describing each area on the map that was given a number. Monsters, treasures, and areas that play an essential role in the adventure should be noted first. Areas of less importance may be stocked (using the guidelines below if desired).\nImportant details: Monsters (including the possibility of patrols in the area), traps, tricks, treasures, or special magical effects that are present should be noted.\nSecondary details: Additional descriptive details for each area may also be noted: furnishings, everyday items, smells, sounds, lights, etc.\nDungeon Levels # Dungeons often consist of a series of deeper and deeper floors—known as \u0026lsquo;levels\u0026rsquo;—accessible by stairways, trap doors, chutes, pits, etc. PCs enter the 1st level of a dungeon initially and may discover entrances to deeper levels.\nDanger and Reward # The level of danger and the amount of treasure in a dungeon should be suitable to the level of the PCs.\nIt is usual for lower levels of the dungeon to have greater risks and rewards. Normally, 1 HD monsters live in the 1st level of a dungeon, 2 HD monsters in the 2nd level, and so on.\nUnguarded Treasure # Monsters or traps usually guard treasure, but sometimes, an unguarded cache of loot may be found.\nExperienced players: When designing dungeons for experienced players, the referee should consider placing only very few completely unguarded treasures.\nDeep dungeon levels: The referee may wish not to place any unguarded treasures in the 9th or deeper dungeon levels.\nRandom Room Stocking # d6 Contents Chance of Treasure 1–2 Empty 1-in-6 3–4 Monster 3-in-6 5 Special None 6 Trap 2-in-6 Monsters: These may be selected by hand or rolled on an encounter table.\nSpecials: Weird or magical features of an area, including tricks or puzzles.\nTraps: If treasure is present, the trap may be set so that it is triggered when the treasure is tampered with (a treasure trap). Otherwise, the trap may be triggered by simply entering the room or a certain area (a room trap).\nTreasure: If a monster is in the room, roll the treasure type indicated in its description. Otherwise, the treasure depends on the dungeon level (see below).\nExample Room Traps # Falling block: Inflicts 1d10 damage (save versus petrification to avoid). Gas: Poisonous gas fills the room (save versus poison or die). Mist: Harmless; looks like poison gas. Pit: Opens up beneath characters’ feet, inflicting falling damage on any who fall in (see Falling). Scything blade: Swings from the ceiling, attacking for 1d8 damage. Slide: Opens up beneath characters’ feet, sending them to a lower level. Example Treasure Traps # Darts: 1d6 spring-loaded darts fire at the character, doing 1d4 damage each. Flash of light: Causes blindness for 1d8 turns (save versus spells). Hidden monster: e.g., a snake; released when the treasure is disturbed. Illusion: Typically of a monster. The monster has AC 9 [10] and vanishes if hit in combat. Its attacks do not inflict real damage: a PC who appears to die just falls unconscious for 1d4 turns. Spray: A mysterious liquid covers the character. Monsters are attracted to the smell: the chance of wandering monsters is doubled for 1d6 hours. Sprung needle: A needle coated with poison jabs out (save vs. poison or die). Example Specials # Alarms: Entry alarm that attracts nearby guardians. Animating objects: Inanimate objects that attack if disturbed. Falling blocks: Stone block falls to prevent passage. Illusions: Illusionary passages, doors, or stairways. Shifting architecture: Doors lock, and the room rotates, rises, or falls. Strange waters: Pool or fountain with weird, magical effects. Teleports: Magical portal or teleporter to another area of the dungeon. Trapdoors: Leading to a hidden area. Voices: Walls or architectural features speak or moan (e.g., a talking statue). Treasure in Empty / Trapped Rooms # Level 1: 1d6 × 100sp; 50%: 1d6 × 10gp; 5%: 1d6 gems; 2%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 2%: 1 magic item.\nLevel 2–3: 1d12 × 100sp; 50%: 1d6 × 100gp; 10%: 1d6 gems; 5%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 8%: 1 magic item.\nLevel 4–5: 1d6 × 1,000sp; 1d6 × 200gp; 20%: 1d6 gems; 10%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 10%: 1 magic item.\nLevel 6–7: 1d6 × 2,000sp; 1d6 × 500gp; 30%: 1d6 gems; 15%: 1d6 pieces of jewellery; 15%: 1 magic item.\nLevel 8–9: 1d6 × 5,000sp; 1d6 × 1,000gp; 40%: 1d12 gems; 20%: 1d12 pieces of jewellery; 20%: 1 magic item.\nDesigning a Wilderness # 1. Choose the Setting # Basic geography: Decide on the basic geography and climate of the region to be described, whether it primarily consists of mountains, forest, desert, etc. The size of the region should also be determined.\nMilieu: At this stage, the nature of the milieu being detailed should also be considered: the general level of technology, availability of magic, presence of different monsters and intelligent races, and so on.\nNew campaigns: When starting a new campaign, it is recommended to begin by detailing a small, self-contained area that can be expanded upon over time.\n2. Map the Region # Major terrain features: Using graph or hex paper, create a map of the wilderness area, marking the major terrain features such as mountain ranges, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, forests, swamps, etc. Real-world maps may serve as inspiration for the natural structure and relationship of terrain features.\nScale: Typically, a large-scale map (24 miles per hex) is drawn first, followed by smaller-scale maps (6 miles per hex) of certain areas, adding more detail.\n3. Locate Human Realms # Mark the areas controlled by humans, bearing in mind the needs of human civilization (rivers, farmland, etc.).\nGovernment: Also note the ruler of each human-controlled area: a petty lord, a mighty king, a league of merchants, etc.\nBase town (see step 5): This is typically placed in one of these regions.\n4. Locate Non-Human Realms # Mark regions controlled by other intelligent species in the setting (e.g., demihumans, monstrous races, and so on), taking their preferred environment and way of life into account.\nNomads: Some intelligent species may keep domains with well-defined boundaries while others may move around—hunting or raiding—within a more vaguely defined area.\nMonsters: The territories of significant, non-intelligent monsters may also be marked on the map at this stage.\n5. Place the Base Town # Locate a base town for player characters on the map, typically close to a river or road near the center of the map. This is where the play will begin. The guidelines in Designing a Base Town may flesh out the base town.\n6. Place Dungeons # Place one or more dungeons on the map somewhere near the base town.\nDistance: Dungeons are generally located around a day’s journey from the base town—close enough that travel between the town and the dungeon is convenient but not so close that the town is plagued by monsters from the dungeon.\n7. Create Regional Encounter Tables # Standard tables: The standard encounter tables (see ***Wilderness Encounters may be suited to some areas of the campaign map.\nCustom tables: For other areas, the referee may prefer to create new tables with a selection of monsters customized to the area. Special encounter tables should take account of the intelligent and monstrous species marked on the map.\nDesigning a Base Town # 1. Determine Size # Decide how large the base town is and roughly how many inhabitants it has. The size of settlements generally depends on the level of technology available in the setting. For medieval or similar settings, the following may be used as a guide:\nTown Size Inhabitants Village 50–999 Small Town 1,000–4,999 Large Town 5,000–14,999 City 15,000+ 2. Note Services # Make some notes on the presence of the following services that adventurers may require:\nBlack market: For selling treasure and contacting thieves or smugglers. Guard: A town militia or police force to keep the peace and protect the town. It may be useful to note whether the guards are open to bribery and how frequently they patrol various areas of the town. Healing: Some means for characters to cure their wounds (and possibly more advanced services such as curing diseases or raising the dead). In settings where magical healing exists, such services may be available at a temple, church, or shrine. Lodgings: Rooms to rent, inns, etc. Rumors: Places where notices are posted and gossip spreads. 3. Detail Ruler # Decide how the town is ruled: whether by a local sheriff or mayor appointed by a lord, an elected council, a confederacy of merchants, etc. It is also possible that a high-level NPC adventurer (with attendant guards and magic) may rule the town.\n4. Detail Other NPCs # Other vital NPCs in the town should be noted, especially those associated with one of the above-mentioned services or those who might wish to hire the PCs to undertake missions.\n5. Create Rumours # A few local rumors may be noted to provide hooks for the player characters to start exploring the local area and find their way to one of the placed dungeons.\nAwarding XP # All characters who return from an adventure alive receive experience points (XP). XP is gained from two sources: treasure recovered and monsters defeated.\nRecovered Treasure # Treasure that PCs bring back from an adventure is the primary means by which they gain XP—usually accounting for ¾ or more of the total XP earned.\nNon-magical treasure: Characters gain 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) value of the treasure.\nMagical treasure: Does not grant XP.\nDefeated Monsters # All monsters defeated by the party (i.e., slain, outsmarted, captured, scared away, etc.) grant XP based on how powerful they are. See the table below.\nBase XP: The XP value of a monster is determined by its Hit Dice.\nBonus XP / ability: A monster’s XP value is increased for each special ability it has. Special abilities are indicated by asterisks following the monster’s HD rating.\nMonsters with bonus hit points: Monsters whose HD are notated as a number of dice plus a fixed hit point bonus (e.g., HD 4+2) are more powerful and are listed separately in the table.

Likewise, players who did not do their share of the work may be penalized.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/scape/","title":"Scape","section":"Sean Wolcott","content":" Scape # A fantasy roleplaying game for the Planescape setting.\nCentral Tenets of Scape # Player characters are not superheroes. They are denizens of the planes just like everyone else. What separates them from the rest is their choices. Even mighty heores can fall to a single stroke of a weapon. Mortals are mortal. They are fragile. Even the mighty Achilles or Ajax is slain with a single arrow or spear stroke. The trick is to avoid getting hit, or even better avoid letting anyone want to hit you in the first place. Roleplay is not about combat, narrative, numbers, nor personality, but about choices. The important things that happen are the ways the player characters affect the world around them. Character growth is not a growth in numbers. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect STR or HP to alter dramatically. Expect a growth in what you are capable of. Ideas and extraordinary abliities are represented as items. Among the planes, the abstract tends to be represented as the physical. Your character\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; is the items that give them abilities. Your level up abilities are tattoos you collect. Even your XP is represented as chips, to be traded and spent. The referee is there to challege the characters\u0026rsquo; viewpoints as much as their safety. This is more about perspective and philosophy than it is about killing monsters. The strange creatures are to be feared for their ideas more than fang and claw. Rules are for skipping ahead in time. We don\u0026rsquo;t include rules for the important parts of the game: choices, ethics, planar travel. That\u0026rsquo;s because we want you to take your time on those areas and explore them fully through roleplay and a dialogue between each other and the referee. We include rules for parts we want to get over quickly: combat, skill checks, powers, even making characters and leveling up. We made them simple and quick so they can make room for the important parts. Similarly, saves made out of combat are for skipping past unimportant bits. Character Creation # Roll 3d6. This is your max STR score. Roll 3d6. This is your max DEX score. Roll 3d6. This is your max WIL score. Record your STR, DEX and WIL edge as 0. Roll 1d6. This is your max HP. Add 3 days' rations to your inventory. This takes only one equipment slot. Pick a starting equipment set. Add these to your inventory. Record your worn items and your weapon damage. Record your AC based on your worn armor. Roll 3d6. This is your starting jink. Write a sentence or two about your character\u0026rsquo;s profession before heading out to adventure the planes. Pick a name. Rules # Basic interaction Describe your actions to the referee. They will decide if you succeed or fail. They may ask you to roll a save to determine success. Ability scores You have three ability scores. They act as hit points. They start as the same value as your max ability scores, and may not exceed the max. Applying effort, using special equipment, or taking damage while critically injured can result in lowering your ability scores. If your WIL score reaches 0, you are stupefied until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain 1 fatigue. If your DEX score reaches 0, you are immobilized until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain 1 fatigue. If your STR score reaches 0, you are dead. Forever. Saves To avoid a negative effect, roll 1d20. If the number is less than or equal to your relevant ability, you succeed. Advantage/Disadvantage If an action is particularly easy, the referee may request a roll be made with advantage, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the more favorable roll. Conversely, if an action is particularly difficult, the referee may request a roll be made with disadvantage, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the less favorable roll. Effort A player may turn a roll with disadvantage into a normal roll, or turn a normal roll into a roll with advantage, by applying effort. Applying effort gives the ability score for that roll 3 damage after the effect of the roll is applied. A player can only apply effort once per roll. Edge Activating ability in equipment or applying effort will lower ability scores by a fixed cost. Having an edge decreases the cost by the amount of edge for that ability score. For example, if an ability costs 3 STR, and your STR edge is 1, you lose 2 STR to use that ability. The minimum cost is 0. Profession If the referee determines that the character\u0026rsquo;s profession would result in them being more skilled than usual at that task, the player may assume a minimum edge of 1 for effort applied to that action. AC and HP Any damage received is first reduced by your AC score. If AC cannot reduce it to 0, then the remainder is taken from your HP. Once HP is 0, the remaining damage dealt is taken from the relevant ability score. Physical damage reduces STR, while other effects like magic or poisons may affect DEX or WIL instead. Critical Damage The moment your HP reaches 0 as a result of taking damage, roll a STR save. On a failure, you gain 1 fatigue, you are disabled and can only moan for help and try to crawl to safety. Equipment Slots You have 10 equipment slots to start, 4 of which are considered to be worn or carried. Each piece of equipment you take with you (except coins) takes up equipment slots. Most equipment takes up 1 slot. Small items can be grouped into a single slot. Bulky items use 2 slots. If you have no unused equipment slots, you cannot carry any more equipment and are considered deprived. Carrying a person is considered bulky. Equipment abilities can only be activated while wearing or carrying them. Fatigue You may gain fatigue from various sources such as extreme heat or cold, multiple days without sleep, critical damage, or being downed from ability score damage. Each point of fatigue gained renders a single inventory slot unusable. If this leaves you with no usable inventory slots, you are fatigued. If you have more items equipped than you have usable slots, you must drop the remaining equipment. A full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink removes 1 fatigue. Deprivation Extreme environments, magical effects, and having all usable equipment slots filled causes you to be deprived. While deprived, you cannot restore HP, STR, DEX, nor WIL by resting. Healing Resting allows damage to be recovered to the max score. HP can be restored with a few minutes of rest. STR, DEX, and WIL need a full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink to be restored. Temporary injuries can only have their effects removed with a week of bedrest and a skilled healer. Combat # When combat starts, the game gets a little more structured. Combat happens in the following sequence:\nRoll initiative Everyone makes a DEX save. Surprise Turn Everyone who passed the save takes their turn. Morale Referee rolls to see if the characters under their control flee. Enemy Turn Characters under referee control take their turn. Party Turn Everyone who failed the save takes their turn. End of Round If combat is still ongoing, go to step 1. On a turn # Each character on their turn gets to move and perform an action.\nActions include, but are not limited to:\nAttack If the enemy is within range of the weapon, the attack succeeds. Roll the damage indicated by the weapon. Unarmed Attack If the enemy is within reach, the attack succeeds. The enemy takes 1 damage. Use Equipment They may use the equipment at a tool, or an improvsied weapon, or may activate an ability the equipment gives them. They do so by wearing or holding the equipment as appropriate. Merely carrying it (such as in a backpack) is not sufficient. Interact They may push a button, open a door, roll a barrel, or interact with any other reachable object in their environment. Improvise They may try to do anything else that the character can think of that\u0026rsquo;s capable of being done in a few seconds. The referee determines the outcome. Morale # Each round the referee makes a determination on whether the creatures flee and end the combat. This can be done \u0026ldquo;by feel\u0026rdquo;, or by doing the following procedure.\nRoll a WIL save on behalf of the creatures. One save for the entire group. If they are especially cowardly creatures, or have lost half their group, the roll with disadvantage. If they have an experienced leader, they roll with advantage. If they fail, they attempt to flee and combat is ended. Character Advancement # Experience # XP is gained for attaining goals, discovering new places, and making critical decisions. XP is represented as poker chips. 1 XP is given to each player in a group when the group as a whole is being rewarded. If a single player is being rewarded, the referee gives 2 XP to the player: 1 XP the player keeps for themself, 1 XP is given to another player while stating a reason they deserve it. XP can be traded freely among players. XP can also be spent to \u0026ldquo;grease the wheels\u0026rdquo; of roleplaying, obtaining some minor goal without having to roleplay it or risk failure. Doing so costs the party 4XP.\nXP can be spent to reverse the effects of a bad roll. The player may choose to surrender 1 XP to the referee after failing the save, and avoids whatever the most recent roll\u0026rsquo;s bad effect as if it never happened.\nXP can also be spent to make the character stronger by purchasing tattoos. A player can spend 4 XP to gain any one of the following tattoos. A player may not take a particular tattoo if it was one of their 3 most recently purchased tattoos. That means at most the same tattoo can only be gained for every 4 tattoo purchases.\nTattoos # Mark of Vitality: This tattoo causes you to grow grotesquely muscly. You can perform great feats of strength more often, but maybe you should refrain from delicate tasks like petting kittens. Increase your STR edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Agility: This tattoo causes you to be quicker and more twitchy. Your reflexes are enchanced. Never mind the occasional spasms. That\u0026rsquo;s just your nervous system going into overdrive. Increase your DEX edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Intellect: With this mark your neural pathways have opened and you can see the connections you couldn\u0026rsquo;t before. Also, does anyone else see all the eyes everywhere? Increase your WIL edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Health: You can dodge so well with this mark that time seems to move a bit slower for you. You\u0026rsquo;re not sure why everyone keeps complaining about you talking so fast. Increase max HP by 2. Mark of Burden: Life is a tetris game. You can see the optimal packing for your stuff. And how to optimally pack everything else, all the time. Increase your number of inventory slots by 1, not to exceed 14. Mark of Skill: Multitasking is what it\u0026rsquo;s all about. You can hold so many things at once. Juggling seems trivial now. You know because you never stop doing it. Increase the number of inventory slots which can be worn or carried by 1, not to exceed 6. Mark of Toughness: Your favorite set of armor is so broken in and perfectly molded to your form that it feels like another layer of skin. That\u0026rsquo;s why it feels like you\u0026rsquo;re ripping your skin off whenever you remove it. Choose one armor type. Increase the AC of that armor type by 1 when you wear it. You may only select this tattoo once. Mark of Arcana: You just got your favorite scroll tattooed right on your skin so now it lives rent-free in your brain, pushing out some core memories that lived there. If you could remember what it was, you might be upset you lost it, but you can\u0026rsquo;t, so you don\u0026rsquo;t. Choose a scroll from your inventory. That spell is able to be cast without needing to equip a scroll. Each time you purchase this tattoo it must be for a different spell. The referee should expand this list as a campaign goes on to reflect the experiences of the characters. This way the characters wear their own stories and experiences on their skin. These additional tattoos should be permanent abilities, such as gaining an ability from a certain item. Tattoos which improve numeric superiority should not be added.\nEquipment and Jink # The monetary currency of the planes is jink. Values listed in the equipment tables is their sale value. Trading in unwanted equipment typically nets half the sale value.\nStarting Equipment # Pick one of these when first creating a character. They are not otherwise for sale as a unit.\nArmor # Armor type AC Inventory slots Sale Value (jink) Plain clothes 0 0 - Light 1 1 10 Heavy 2 2 50 Weapons # Weapon type STR Damage Inventory slots Ability (STR cost) Sale Value (jink) Unarmed 1 0 - Light 3 1 Sneak Attack: +3 damage (2) 2 Medium 4 1 Critical: Ignore HP, damage STR directly (3) 8 Heavy 5 2 Cleave: Target all enemies within reach (4) 21 Ranged 3 2 Cover: Attacks against the party must pass a DEX save or miss (2) 13 Tools # Tool Inventory Slots Ability (DEX cost) Sale Value (jink) Shield 1 Parry: +1 AC until next turn (2) 5 Climbing Gear 1 Scale walls and overhangs overwise unclimbable by skilled climbers (3) 5 Thieves\u0026rsquo; tools 1 Open locks and disarm traps that are not crackable by an a skilled lockpicker (2) 8 Cloak of Shadows 1 Hide in dim light in ways a normal person can\u0026rsquo;t (2) 8 Sneaky boots 1 Move more silently than a cat (3) 5 Magical and Ceremonial Gear # Gear Inventory Slots Ability (WIL cost) Sale Value (jink) Scroll 1 Cast Spell: the spell written on it takes effect (3) 50 Holy Symbol 1 Turn Undead: Weak undead are chased away (2) 50 Prayer Beads 1 Lay on Hands: Heal 1 STR, DEX, or WIL damage on touched creature per WIL spent (varies) 30 Miscellaneous Items # Item Inventory Slots Ability Sale Value (jink) Burglar\u0026rsquo;s goggles 1 Evasion: STR damage is first taken from DEX 50 Cloak of the War Mage 1 Mage Armor: STR damage is first taken from WIL 50 War pipes 2 Heavy weapon, deals WIL damage rather than STR, Cleave costs 4 WIL`` 30 Bolas 1 Light weapon, deals DEX damage rather than STR, Sneak attack costs 2 DEX`` Net 1 Medium weapon, deals DEX damage rather than STR, Critical costs 3 DEX`` 1d100 Spell Scrolls # d100 Spell Name Description 01 Glimmerwhisk Summons a shimmering, whisk-like object that gently cleans and polishes small items for 1 minute. 02 Pocket Portal Creates a temporary, tiny portal to a random pocket dimension, useful for hiding small objects. 03 Breeze of Forgetfulness A soft breeze flows through, causing creatures in a small area to momentarily forget what they were doing. 04 Featherweight Arms Makes weapons in an area as light as feathers, reducing their damage but allowing easy handling. 05 Slippery Shoes Makes the target’s shoes incredibly slippery, causing awkward movement but increasing dodge ability. 06 Paper-to-Copper Transmutes ordinary paper into 1 copper coin per sheet.

Referee's Guide","section":"Thievery! Referee's Guide","content":" Placing Treasure # There are two methods of deciding what treasure is in the possession of monsters: rolling randomly and referee choice.\nMethod 1: Rolling Randomly # Monster listings note which treasure type is present in the creature’s lair and which it may carry on its person. See Treasure Types for details on how to roll treasure according to a treasure type letter code.\nManual Adjustments # If the value of the randomly generated treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may adjust the results manually.\nMethod 2: Referee Choice # The referee may wish to choose treasures appropriate to the monsters and the PC party. As treasure is the primary source of XP (see Awarding XP), the referee should carefully consider treasure placement. The following procedure is recommended:\nConsider the size of the adventuring party, the levels of the characters, and the XP they need to go up in level. Decide how many experience points the treasure hoard should provide if the party successfully acquires it. Place treasures whose total value matches the determined XP total. Balance of Reward Versus Danger # When using this approach, the referee should ensure that sufficiently powerful monsters guard the treasure. Adventurers should have to earn this reward!\nItems of Value # Common treasures # The treasure tables (see Treasure Types) describe methods for generating hoards of coins, gems, jewelry, and magic items.\nUnusual treasures # Adventures may also include valuable items of other kinds, whose worth may not always be apparent:\nArtwork: Paintings, statuary. Books: Rare tomes or scrolls. Foodstuffs: Spices, valuable wines. Furnishings: Rugs, tapestries. Utensils: Silver cutlery, unusual kitchen or laboratory implements. Valuables: Furs, ivory, ores, silks. Value and Weight # For each unusual item placed, the referee should note its value (in gold pieces) and (if using the optional rules for Encumbrance) its weight.\nTreasure Types # Rolling Treasure # Each treasure type lists one or more types of coins or items. For each entry in the list:\nIf a percentage is given, first roll d100 to see whether this item is present. If a range of values is given (e.g., 1d6 × 1,000cp, 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine the quantity of this item. For gems, jewelry, and magic items, the procedures for determining the value and properties of the items in the hoard are found in Gems and Jewellery and Magic Items. Manual Adjustments # If the value of the randomly rolled treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may adjust the results manually.\nAverage Values # The average results of gems, jewelry, and all coins, excluding magic items (which have no fixed sale value).\nCoin Conversion Rates # 1pp = 5gp 1gp = 2ep 1gp = 10sp 1gp = 100cp Hoards: A–O # These treasure types indicate the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the monsters’ lair.\nSmall lairs: Monster listings note the number of individuals found in a lair. If the number rolled is below average and the lair encounter size is at least 1d4, the hoard\u0026rsquo;s treasure amount may be reduced accordingly.\nType A (18,000gp average) # 25%: 1d6 × 1,000cp. 30%: 1d6 × 1,000sp. 20%: 1d4 × 1,000ep. 35%: 2d6 × 1,000gp. 25%: 1d2 × 1,000pp. 50%: 6d6 gems. 50%: 6d6 pieces of jewellery. 30%: 3 magic items.

Gems and Jewellery # Gems # The following table determines the value of each gem in a treasure hoard:\nd20 Gem Value 1–4 10gp 5–9 50gp 10–15 100gp 16–19 500gp 20 1,000gp Jewellery # Each piece of jewelry indicated by a treasure type is worth 3d6 × 100gp (or more, if the referee wishes, for characters above 3rd level).\nDamaged Jewellery # Rough treatment of jewelry (e.g., crushing, intense heat or fire, lightning) can damage it, reducing its value by 50%.\nCombining Values # When a treasure type indicates the presence of multiple gems or pieces of jewelry, the referee may combine the values as desired. For example, a roll of five 50gp value gems may be placed as a single 250gp gem, a 100gp gem, three 50gp gems, or any other combination.\nMagic Items (General) # Magic items are usually classified according to one of the following categories:\nArmor and shields: Grant protective benefits to the user. Miscellaneous items: Enchanted items that do not fit into any other category. Potions: Magical liquids stored in glass vials. Rings: Plain or bejeweled rings that place an enchantment about the wearer. Rods / staves / wands: Magical lengths of wood, metal, crystal, etc. Used by spell casters to unleash magical effects. Scrolls and maps: Aged sheets of parchment or paper inscribed with either magical script or instructions leading to a treasure hoard. Note that treasure maps are rolled on the magic items table, although they are not usually magical. Swords: Grant bonuses to hit and damage in combat. It may also be enchanted with additional powers. Weapons: All enchanted weapons other than swords. Grant bonuses to hit and damage in combat. It may also be enchanted with additional powers. Rolling Magic Items # When a treasure type indicates that a magic item is present, the following procedure is used to determine its nature:\nSpecific type of item: If the treasure type indicates a particular type of magic item (e.g., 3 potions), roll on the table for that type of item (found by following the links above). Type of item not specified: Otherwise, first roll on the Magic Item Type table below to determine the type of the item, then roll on the table for that type (found by following the links in the table). Basic and Expert Magic Items # Separate probabilities are listed in the table for Basic and Expert level characters (i.e., characters of 1st to 3rd level and characters of 4th level or higher). The Basic probabilities are listed in the B column and the Expert probabilities in the X column.\nIt is recommended that the probabilities appropriate to the group’s experience level be used. Alternatively, if the referee prefers to have an even distribution of magic items, irrespective of player character level, the Expert probabilities may always be used.\nB: d% X: d% Type of Item 01–10 01–10 Armor or Shield 11–15 11–15 Miscellaneous Item 16–40 16–35 Potion 41–45 36–40 Ring 46–50 41–45 Rod / Staff / Wand 51–70 46–75 Scroll or Map 71–90 76–95 Sword 91–00 96–00 Weapon Identifying Magic Items # Testing: The most common way of identifying magic items is by trial and error—sipping a potion, donning a suit of armor, using a weapon in battle, etc.\nRetainers: Players may wish to use retainers as “guinea pigs” to test magic items of unknown properties. Retainers may agree to do this, but only if allowed to keep the item in question.\nBy magic: High-level NPC magic-users may also be able to identify magic items. They will always require payment or service in kind. The process takes time, possibly several weeks.\nUsing Magic Items # Appropriate use: To be effective, a magic item must be used, held, or worn after the normal fashion for that type of object.\nConcentration: To activate an item’s magic, the user must concentrate on its effect. When using a magic item this way, the character cannot take any other actions.\nItems that are always active: The following items do not require concentration and are always active: magic swords, weapons, armor, and protective items (e.g., rings of protection).\nActions per round: A magic item’s effect can normally be used only once per round unless its description notes otherwise.\nWishes # Some magic items grant wishes, the powerful ability for a character to change the nature of reality in any conceivable way they desire. Wishes are generally regarded as the most powerful magic in the game and have the potential to greatly upset the balance of play if not handled carefully by the referee.\nAdjudication Guidelines # Wording: The player and referee must pay great attention to the precise language of a wish.\nFundamental changes: A wish to alter some fundamental aspect of the game or the campaign world will have no effect. For example, a wish that transformed the abilities of all monsters of a particular type would fail.\nGreedy wishes: A wish that the referee judges to be unreasonable or overly greedy may come to pass but with its intent twisted in some way. For example, a wish for a potent magic item may cause the item to appear, but in the possession of a dangerous enemy.\nWishing for more wishes: This will result in an infinite time loop, putting the character out of play.\nExample Wishes # Some examples of reasonable wishes:\nWishing for a weapon to help fight magical monsters. The wish may grant a +1 sword that vanishes when the combat ends. Wishing that a monster had not attacked. The wish may place the characters back in time and change the monster\u0026rsquo;s reaction. Wishing that a deadly blow had not occurred. The affected character may return to life, wounded but not dead.

This modifier worsens the wearer’s Armor Class score. For example, a cursed suit of chainmail -1 grants a base Armor Class of 6 [13], one point worse than the AC 5 [14] of non-magical chainmail.\nAC 9 [10]: Some types of cursed armor give the wearer a base Armor Class of 9 [10] (before modifiers due to Dexterity).\nTesting: All types of tests indicate that a cursed shield or suit of armor is enchanted with a +1 bonus. It is only when the armor is used in deadly combat that the curse is revealed.\nRemoving: Once a cursed shield or suit of armor has been used, the character comes under the curse and cannot discard the item. It can only be removed with magic.\nEnchanted Armor and Shields # AC bonus: Enchanted armor and shields specify a protective bonus that improves the wearer’s Armor Class score. For example, a suit of chainmail +1 grants a base Armor Class of 4 [15], one point better than the AC 5 [14] of non-magical chainmail.\nWeight: If using the optional rules for detailed encumbrance (see Encumbrance), the enchanted armor’s encumbrance value is 50% less than that of normal armor.\nType of Armor # The referee may choose the type of armor in a treasure hoard or may roll on the following table:\nd8 Type of Armor 1–2 Leather 3–6 Chainmail 7–8 Plate mail Miscellaneous Items # B: d10 X: d% Item 01-03 Amulet of Protection Against Scrying 1 04-05 Bag of Devouring 2 06-11 Bag of Holding 12-16 Boots of Levitation 17-21 Boots of Speed 22-26 Boots of Travelling and Leaping 3 27-31 Broom of Flying 4 32-35 Crystal Ball 36-37 Crystal Ball with Clairaudience 38 Crystal Ball with ESP 39-40 Displacer Cloak 41 Drums of Panic 42 Efreeti Bottle 43 Elemental Summoning Device: Air 44 Elemental Summoning Device: Earth 45 Elemental Summoning Device: Fire 46 Elemental Summoning Device: Water 5 47-56 Elven Cloak and Boots 57 Flying Carpet 6 58-64 Gauntlets of Ogre Power 65-66 Girdle of Giant Strength 7 67-77 Helm of Alignment Changing 78-82 Helm of Reading Languages and Magic 8 83 Helm of Telepathy 84 Helm of Teleportation 85 Horn of Blasting 9 86-90 Medallion of ESP 30’ 91-93 Medallion of ESP 90’ 94-94 Mirror of Life Trapping 10 95-97 Rope of Climbing 98-00 Scarab of Protection B: Basic characters (levels 1–3) X: Expert characters (level 4+)\nUsage: All characters (unless noted).\nActivating: Unless an item’s description states otherwise, it may be used any number of times per day and is activated by concentration.\nPotions # B: d8 X: d% Potion 01–03 Clairaudience 04–07 Clairvoyance 08–10 Control Animal 11–13 Control Dragon 14–16 Control Giant 17–19 Control Human 20–22 Control Plant 23–25 Control Undead 26–32 Delusion 1 33–35 Diminution 2 36–39 ESP 40–43 Fire Resistance 44–47 Flying 3 48–51 Gaseous Form 52–55 Giant Strength 4 56–59 Growth 5 60–63 Healing 64–68 Heroism 6 69–72 Invisibility 73–76 Invulnerability 7 77–80 Levitation 81–84 Longevity 8 85–86 Poison 87–89 Polymorph Self 90–97 Speed 98–00 Treasure Finding B: Basic characters (levels 1–3) X: Expert characters (level 4+)\nUsage: All characters (unless noted).\nIdentifying: A potion may be identified by sipping a small amount. It is difficult to identify potions purely by smell or taste, as even potions with the same effect are different.\nDrinking: Drinking a full dose of a potion takes one round\nDuration: The magical effect of a full dose of a potion lasts for 1d6+6 turns. The referee should roll for and track this duration and keep the player from knowing how long the potion will last.\nMixing Potions # Drinking a potion while already under the effects of another potion is dangerous:\nSickness: The character is completely disabled for 3 turns due to sickness.

The referee should determine the nature of the curse (see examples below).\nRemoving: A curse can be removed by magic or (at the referee’s option) by performing a special quest.\nExample Curses # Transformation: The reader changes into a harmless creature (e.g., a frog). Summoning: A wandering monster appears next to the reader and attacks (gaining surprise). The monster is of equal level to the reader. Lost item: A magic item in the reader’s possession vanishes. The referee may select the item or choose it at random. Energy drain: The reader permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points and all other benefits due to the lost level (e.g., spells, saving throws, etc.). A character’s XP is reduced halfway between the former and new levels. A person who loses all levels dies. Ability score re-roll: The player must re-roll the character’s prime requisite.

A map may be incomplete, worded in riddles, or written in an obscure language.\nPreparing in advance: The referee should prepare treasure maps in advance.\nTreasures # The following list of treasure map types may be used to determine the nature of the treasure that a map leads to.\nI: 1 magic item. II: 1d6 × 10 gems and 2d10 pieces of jewellery. III: 2 magic items. IV: 3 magic items (no swords). V: 3 magic items and 1 potion. VI: 3 magic items, 1 scroll, 1 potion.

Such swords are extremely powerful and are always sentient. See Sentient Swords for rules for determining the powers of a sword with a special purpose.\nProbability: There is a 1-in-20 chance of a magic sword having a special purpose. The referee may choose to only place such swords by design rather than rolling this chance randomly.\nSword +1, Energy Drain # It drains the life energy of its victims.\nOn a successful hit: The wielder may command the sword to drain the victim’s life energy. Energy drain: Besides suffering normal damage, the target permanently loses one experience level (or Hit Die). This incurs a loss of one Hit Die of hit points and all other benefits due to the drained level (e.g., spells, saving throws, etc.). A character’s XP is reduced to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels dies. Charges: The sword may drain a total of 1d4+4 levels. Once this many levels have been drained, it becomes a normal magical sword +1. Sword +1, Flaming # Bursts into flames, on command.

After being thrown: It returns to its wielder’s hands. Sentient Swords # If a magic sword possesses sentience (see Swords for the likelihood), the procedure on this page may be used to determine its powers. (Alternatively, the referee may select its qualities as desired.)\nRolling a Sentient Sword # Special purpose: If the sword has a special purpose, see Special Purpose of Sentient Swords to determine what it is.\nIntelligence and personality: The sword’s INT is 1d6+6. (Swords imbued with a special purpose always have INT 12.) The sword has a personality and should be played as an NPC.\nCommunication:\nThe sword’s INT determines how it can communicate. See the table below.\nEmpathy: The sword cannot communicate directly but empathically informs the wielder of its powers and how to use them. Speech: The sword speaks out loud. The number of languages it knows is indicated by rolling on the languages table; see below. The referee should select the languages. Reading: The sword can read all languages it can speak and magical inscriptions. Alignment: See the table below.\nPowers: The sword’s INT determines the number of powers it has. See the table below. Powers are described in the links below.\nEgo: Sentient swords have an Ego rating—a measure of their force of personality. This is rolled on 1d12. Swords imbued with a special purpose always have an Ego of 12.\nINT Reading Communication 7 No Empathy 8 No Empathy 9 No Empathy 10 No Speech 11 Yes Speech 12 Yes Speech d100 Languages 01–50 Alignment tongue + 1 51–70 Alignment tongue + 2 71–85 Alignment tongue + 3 86–95 Alignment tongue + 4 96–99 Alignment tongue + 5 00 Roll twice again, adding results d20 Alignment 01–13 Lawful 14–18 Neutral 19–20 Chaotic INT Powers 7 1 sensory power 8 2 sensory powers 9 3 sensory powers 10 3 sensory powers 11 3 sensory powers 12 3 sensory powers + 1 extraordinary Using a Sentient Sword # Sentient swords grant the wielder special powers beyond a normal magic sword, but using one also carries risks.\nActivating Powers # In hand: To use a power, the sword must be in the wielder’s hand. Concentration: The wielder must concentrate to activate a power. Alignment # The alignment of the sword can only be determined by touching it. Doing so may incur damage if the character is of a different alignment to the sword:\nLawful swords: Inflict 1d6 damage per round to neutral characters and 2d6 per round to chaotic characters. Neutral swords: Inflict 1d6 damage per round to non-neutral characters. Chaotic swords: Inflict 1d6 damage per round to neutral characters and 2d6 per round to lawful characters. Control # A sentient sword has its own personality and can sometimes attempt to exercise control over the person who wields it. A control check (see below) is triggered in any of the following circumstances:\nFirst contact: Upon the character first touching the sword. Wounded: When the character is reduced to half hit points or less. Jealousy: When another magic weapon comes into the character’s possession. Alignment difference: Upon every use, if the sword and the character are of different alignments. Special purpose: If the sword has a special purpose, every time the special purpose is applicable. (e.g., when encountering a character or creature of the type the sword is designed to slay.) Control Checks # When one of the circumstances above occurs, a control check is required:\nDetermine the sword’s Will score: The sum of its INT and Ego. Add one for each extraordinary power the sword has. Add 1d10 if the sword and the wielder are different alignments. Determine the wielder’s Will score: The sum of STR and WIS scores. If the character has less than full hit points, Will is reduced by 1d4 (or 2d4 if the character has less than half hit points). Compare the Will scores. If the sword’s Will score is higher, it takes control of the character’s actions. When the Sword Takes Control # The referee determines the behavior of the character via the sword, for example:\nJealousy: Discarding other weapons or ignoring newly discovered magic weapons. Glory: Charging into battle to gain glory for the sword. Surrender: To a foe whom the sword deems either more worthy of possessing it or more susceptible to being controlled. Indulgence: Making lavish expenditures for the sword. Purchasing expensive sheaths, having jewels fitted, having enchantments and wards applied, etc. The sword may force the character to spend most of their money on such things! Ending Control # Once in control, the sword will only release the character when the circumstance that triggered the control check is over or when the sword is otherwise satisfied.\nExtraordinary Powers # See Extraordinary Powers of Sentient Swords.\nSensory Powers # See Sensory Powers of Sentient Swords.\nSpecial Purpose # See Special Purpose of Sentient Swords.\nExtraordinary Powers of Sentient Swords # Each power should be rolled on the table below.
