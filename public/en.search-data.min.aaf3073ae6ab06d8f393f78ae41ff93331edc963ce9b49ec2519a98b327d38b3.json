To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 – Scope.\nLicense grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). Other rights.\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\nAttribution.\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a notice that refers to this Public License; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination.\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\nInability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n5.3.

This * limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or * personal injury resulting from such party\u0026rsquo;s negligence to the * extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Party Organisation # Size: The ideal group size is between 6 and 8 characters—large enough to confront the challenges of the adventure while not so large as to be disorganized. If not enough PCs are present, the players may wish to hire retainers (see Retainers).\nClasses: It is wise for a party to have a mix of characters from different adventuring classes. Combat-focused characters are essential for protecting the group from danger, while other classes each have magic or other special abilities to handle different situations that may arise in an adventure.\nLevel: As new PCs join play, the experience levels of the characters in the party may diverge. It is recommended that characters more than four levels apart should adventure separately, as challenges and rewards suitable to characters of vastly different experience levels do not match.\nMarching Order # Before starting an adventure, the players should determine the typical arrangement of their PCs when exploring. This is known as the party’s marching order. For example, players may move in a two-column formation, with well-armored characters in the front, weaker characters in the middle, and a rear guard. The group may define standard marching orders for common situations (e.g., exploration, combat, opening doors, searching, etc.).\nThe Caller # If the players wish to, they may nominate one of their numbers as the spokesperson of the group, known as the caller. This player is responsible for informing the referee about the actions and movements of the party as a whole. Delegating this role to one player—rather than having each player notify the referee of their PC’s individual actions—can speed up play.\nThe caller’s character usually takes on the role of party leader and should thus have a high Charisma score and be located near the front of the party.\nThe Mapper # One player should create a map of the explored areas based on the referee’s descriptions. Details such as monsters or traps encountered, clues to puzzles, or possibly interesting unexplored areas may be noted on the map as it is drawn.\nDividing Treasure # The spoils of an adventure may be divided between surviving characters in whatever way the players agree on.\nNon-magical treasure: This is typically divided evenly between player characters.\nMagic items: The players must decide which character keeps each item. One method is for each player to roll a die and compare the results. The highest-rolling player gets to pick a magic item first, the second-highest-rolling player gets the next pick, and so on.\nTime, Weight, Movement # Tracking Time # When an adventure is underway, the referee should keep track of the time that elapses in the imagined world, known as game time. This is distinct from real time: what may take the players and referee mere seconds to describe may take PCs hours or even days to complete.\nFor example, when characters explore a dungeon, the referee tracks the number of turns that have elapsed; when characters are exploring the wilderness, the number of days elapsed is tracked.\nThe referee must adjudicate what may be accomplished in a given period.\nResources # As game time passes, the referee should pay attention to the resources that the party consumes. For example, food, water, fuel for light sources, durations of spells or magical effects, etc.\nTracking Movement # As player characters explore the imagined world, the referee should keep track of their location on a prepared map. The map is usually kept secret from the players, who must rely on the referee’s descriptions of the areas they explore.\nThe referee should refer to the characters\u0026rsquo; movement rates to determine how long it takes for characters to move from one area to the next (see Game Statistics).\nGroup Movement Rate # An adventuring party will usually want to stay together. The speed of the slowest member determines the movement rate of the party as a whole.\nMeasurements # Time: Rounds and Turns # Aside from everyday time increments (minutes, hours, days, and so on), the following special units are used in the game.\nTurns: 10 minutes of game time. There are six turns in an hour. Time is measured in turns when exploring dungeons (see Dungeon Adventuring).\nRounds: 10 seconds of game time. There are 60 rounds in a turn. Time is measured in rounds during encounters, especially in combat (see Encounters and Combat).\nDistance: Inches, Feet, Yards, Miles # This game uses imperial or customary US units to stay true to its origins. Distances are measured in inches (notated with a ”), feet (notated with a ’), yards, and miles.\nDistance Conversions # 1 foot = 12 inches 1 yard = 3 feet 1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet Weight: Coins # Weight measures typically come into play only when discussing how much characters can carry (see Encumbrance below). As coins are the most common treasure adventurers find, all weights are measured in coins. (Ten coins are equivalent to one pound.)\nEncumbrance (Optional Rule) # Some groups may wish to use a system to track the amount of gear and treasure a character can carry and how this affects their movement rate.\nTracking Encumbrance # Encumbrance measures both the weight and bulk a character is carrying.\nTreasure: The encumbrance of treasure carried by a character should be tracked. The encumbrance of common items of treasure is shown in the table below. The referee should decide the weight of other forms of treasure.\nEquipment: Two options for tracking the encumbrance of characters’ equipment are presented below. The same system should be applied to all characters.\nMaximum load: Any character can carry 1,600 coins of weight. Characters carrying more than this cannot move.\nTreasure Weight in Coins Coin (any type) 1 Gem 1 Jewellery (1 piece) 10 Potion 10 Rod 20 Scroll 1 Staff 40 Wand 10 Option 1: Basic Encumbrance # Treasure: The treasure\u0026rsquo;s weight is tracked to ensure that the character’s maximum load is not exceeded.\nEquipment: The weight of armor, weapons, and adventuring gear is not tracked and does not count toward a character’s maximum load.\nMovement rate: This is determined by the type of armor the character is wearing and whether they carry a significant amount of treasure (as judged by the referee). The actual weight of the treasure carried does not affect the movement rate.\nMovement Rate Armor Worn Without Treasure Carrying Treasure Unarmored 120’ (40’) 90’ (30’) Light armor 90’ (30’) 60’ (20’) Heavy armor 60’ (20’) 30’ (10’) Option 2: Detailed Encumbrance # Treasure: The weight of coins and other treasure carried is tracked.\nEquipment: The weight of the character’s armor and weapons is also tracked (the weight of these items is listed in the equipment list. Miscellaneous adventuring gear (backpack, spikes, sacks, etc.) may be counted as 80 coins of weight.\nMovement rate: The character’s movement rate is based on the weight of all significant items carried, including treasure, weapons, and armor.\nEncumbrance Movement Rate Up to 400 coins 120’ (40’) Up to 600 coins 90’ (30’) Up to 800 coins 60’ (20’) Up to 1,600 coins 30’ (10’) Ability Checks # The referee may use a character’s ability scores to determine the character’s chance of succeeding at various challenging tasks.\nRolling an Ability Check # The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the ability, the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.\nModifiers # Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be applied, depending on the difficulty of the task. A modifier of -4 would be a relatively easy ability check, and a +4 would be very difficult.\n1s and 20s # A natural 1 should be treated as a success and a natural 20 treated as a failure.\nDamage, Healing, and Death # All characters and monsters have a hit point total, representing their ability to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat, subtract hit points from this pool.\nDeath # A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.\nDestruction of Items # If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g., a lightning bolt spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.\nDestruction of Magic Items # Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell or special attack may be allowed a chance to survive, as follows:\nSave: For each item, a saving throw may be made using the character’s saving throw values. Bonuses: Items that grant a bonus in combat (e.g., magical weapons and armor) may also apply this bonus to the saving throw. Healing # Natural: A character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points for each full day of complete rest. The character or monster will not heal that day if the rest is interrupted.\nMagical: Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.\nSaving Throws # All characters and monsters can make saving throws to avoid the full effects of certain magical or special attacks.\nCategories # There are five saving throw categories used in the following situations:\nDeath or Poison (D): When targeted by a death ray or poison exposure. Wands (W): When targeted by an effect from a magical wand. Paralysis or Petrification (P): When targeted by an effect that paralyzes or turns to stone. Breath Attacks (B): When targeted by a dragon\u0026rsquo;s breath (or other monsters with a breath attack). Spells, Rods, or Staves (S): When targeted by a baneful spell or an effect from a magical rod or staff. When to Roll a Saving Throw # The appropriate saving throw and the effects of success or failure are indicated in the description of the spell, monster attack, or adventure scenario.\nSaving Throw Tables # Characters: Each character class has its table denoting the saving throw values of characters of each experience level.\nMonsters: Most monsters use the saving throw table under Combat Tables. Some monsters’ descriptions may note that they use the table for a specific character class.\nRolling a Saving Throw # When affected by a spell or attack form that requires a saving throw, the player or referee must roll 1d20 and compare the result to the appropriate saving throw value:\nGreater or equal: A result greater than or equal to the saving throw value is a success. Lower: A result of less than the saving throw value is a failure. Successful Saves # Damaging effects: A successful save against an effect that causes damage means that the damage is halved.\nOther effects: A successful saving throw against an effect that does not cause damage means the effect has been entirely avoided or negated.\nSaving Throws Versus Poison # Failure: A failed save against poison is usually fatal.\nDamage: If a poisonous attack also inflicts damage, the damage is not affected by the success or failure of the saving throw.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/thievery/players-guide/characters/","title":"Characters: Thievery! Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Player Characters # Game Statistics: Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world. Creating a Character: To create a character, you\u0026rsquo;ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character. Ability Scores: A character\u0026rsquo;s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. Alignment: All beings, whether PCs, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies or spheres of behavior, known as alignments. Languages: The native languages a player character speaks are determined by the character\u0026rsquo;s class. Game Statistics # Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.\nAbility Scores # The fundamental physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of the character. There are six ability scores: Strength (abbreviated STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA). A character is ranked in each ability score by 3–18 (3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best).\nClass # An adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character’s class defines their primary abilities (see Character Classes).\nRace # A character may be human or one of several demihuman species. Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is considered human.\nLevel # Their experience level denotes the character’s experience as an adventurer. Characters typically start play at 1st level (the lowest level of adventurer) and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class.\nExperience Points (XP) # Accumulated experience points track the character’s advancement in the game. The referee awards experience points after a successful adventure. The character\u0026rsquo;s level increases when the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.\nPrime Requisite # The ability score (or scores) most important to the character’s class. The character’s score in these abilities can affect the rate at which the character accumulates experience points.\nAlignment # The character (and every other creature in the game world) is aligned with one of three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos (see Alignment). This alignment determines how certain magic influences the character and should be used by the player as a guideline for role-playing the character.\nHit Points (hp) # The character’s ability to avoid dying. The character has a maximum hit point total and a current hit point total, which are tracked separately. When a character is harmed, their current hit point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character is dead! Rest or healing can restore lost hit points (see Damage, Healing, and Death), but never above the character’s maximum hit point total (this is only increased when the character increases in level).\nHit Dice (HD) # The number of dice used to determine the character’s maximum hit point total. The character’s level determines the number of Hit Dice, and their class determines the type of dice rolled (i.e., d4, d6, d8). Some classes also grant a flat bonus to hit points at certain levels.\nArmor Class (AC) # The character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. AC is determined by the character’s armor and their Dexterity score. Lower Armor Class scores are better, so bonuses decrease the character’s AC, and penalties increase it.\nDual format: The equivalent ascending AC is listed in square brackets for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g., AC 5 [14] — an AC of 5 or 14 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\nUnarmored AC: An unarmored character has AC 9 [10].\nAscending AC (Optional Rule) # Some groups are more familiar with an Armor Class system where higher scores are better. This system is known as Ascending Armor Class (abbreviated AAC) and works as follows:\nArmor Class: When using AAC, higher scores are better. Bonuses to Armor Class increase the AAC score, and penalties decrease it. Attack rolls: When using AAC, the procedure for resolving attack rolls involves using an attack bonus instead of a THAC0 score and attack matrix. Note: Using Ascending Armor Class results in slightly different attack probabilities than using the traditional approach of descending AC with an attack matrix.\nAttack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0) # Their class and level determine the character’s ability to hit foes in combat. The THAC0 score indicates which row of the attack matrix (see Combat Tables) to use when attacking. Lower THAC0 scores are better.\nDual format: The equivalent attack bonus is listed in square brackets for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g., THAC0 15 [+4] — a THAC0 of 15, or an attack bonus of +4 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\nAttacking: The procedure for making attack rolls is described in Combat.\nSaving Throw Values # The character’s ability to avoid specific dangerous or detrimental effects. There are five saving throw categories: death (or poison), wands, paralysis (or petrification), breath attacks, and spells (or magic rods or staves). The character’s saving throw values are determined by class and level (see Saving Throws).\nMovement Rate # The speed at which the character can move when exploring, traveling, or during combat. Every character has a base movement rate and an encounter movement rate (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one-third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’ (40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and an encounter movement rate of 40’.\nOverland: The number of miles a character can travel in a day in the wilderness is determined by dividing their base movement rate by five. Exploration: When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn (10 minutes) Class Abilities # Finally, the character’s class denotes a set of special abilities that the character may use, including the ability to use certain types of armor and weapons and to speak one or more languages.\nCreating a Character # To create a character, you’ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.\nA selection of different character sheet PDFs is available at necroticgnome.com. These may be downloaded and printed for use in your games.\n1. Roll Ability Scores # Roll 3d6 in order of your character’s ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (see Ability Scores).\nSub-Par Characters # If you roll a character with abysmal ability scores—for example, an 8 or less in every score or a meager rating in more than one ability—the referee may allow you to discard the character and start again.\n2. Choose a Class # Select one of the classes available (see Character Classes), bearing in mind some classes\u0026rsquo; minimum ability score requirements. The chosen class determines your character’s race—unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is human.\n3. Adjust Ability Scores # If you wish, you may raise your character’s prime requisite of your character by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. One point may be added to a prime requisite for every two points by which an ability score is reduced. The following restrictions apply:\nOnly Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way. No score may be lowered below 9. Some character classes may have additional constraints. 4. Note Ability Score Modifiers # Now that your character’s ability scores are fixed, note any associated bonuses or penalties (see Ability Scores).\n5. Note Attack Values # The level progression chart for your character’s class lists your THAC0 score. This indicates your chance of hitting opponents in combat, as determined by the Attack Matrix.\nFor quick reference, it is convenient to look up the values in the attack matrix row corresponding to the character’s THAC0 (determined by class and level) and record them on your character sheet. 1st level characters have a THAC0 of 19 [0], resulting in the attack values below.\nAscending AC (Optional Rule) # If using the optional rule for Ascending AC, record your attack bonus on your character sheet, instead of the attack matrix quick reference.\nAttack Roll 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 AC Hit 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 6. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities # Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of their class, as well as your character’s saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which spells are recorded. The referee may allow you to choose.\n7. Roll Hit Points # Determine your character’s hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see Ability Scores). Your character always starts with at least 1 hit point, regardless of the CON modifier.\nRe-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule) # If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (before applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is to increase the survivability of 1st-level PCs.\n8. Choose Alignment # Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see Alignment), and note this on your character sheet.\n9. Note Known Languages # Your character’s native languages are listed in the class description. This includes the common tongue and the character’s alignment language—see Languages. Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages from the list available in the setting.\n10. Buy Equipment # Your character starts play with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces (see Wealth). You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under Equipment \u0026amp; Services.\nRemember: Your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g., weapons and armor).\n11. Note Armor Class # Two factors determine your character’s Armor Class:\nArmor: The armor worn determines your character’s base AC. See the equipment lists under Armor. Dexterity: A nimble character is more difficult to attack (see Dexterity under Ability Scores). Unarmored AC # If your character has no armor, their base AC is 9 [10].\n12. Note Level and XP # Your character begins play at 1st level with 0 XP.\n13. Name Character # Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!\nAbility Scores # A character’s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. The tables below list the modifiers associated with each ability score, with the effects described below.\nStrength (STR) # Brawn, muscle power, and physical might.\nMelee: This is applied to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons. Open doors: The chance of success with attempts to force open a stuck door (see Dungeon Adventuring). STR Melee Open Doors 3 -3 1-in-6 4–5 -2 1-in-6 6–8 -1 1-in-6 9–12 None 2-in-6 13–15 +1 3-in-6 16–17 +2 4-in-6 18 +3 5-in-6 Intelligence (INT) # Learning, memory, and reasoning.\nSpoken languages: Denotes the number of languages the character can speak. Literacy: Indicates the character’s ability to read and write their native languages. INT Spoken Languages Literacy 3 Native (broken speech) Illiterate 4–5 Native Illiterate 6–8 Native Basic 9–12 Native Literate 13–15 Native + 1 additional Literate 16–17 Native + 2 additional Literate 18 Native + 3 additional Literate Wisdom (WIS) # Insight, common sense, and intuition.\nMagic saves: Is applied to saving throws (see Saving Throws) versus magical effects. This does not typically include saves against breath attacks but may apply to any other saving throw category. WIS Magic Saves 3 -3 4–5 -2 6–8 -1 9–12 None 13–15 +1 16–17 +2 18 +3 Dexterity (DEX) # Agility, reflexes, speed, and balance.\nAC: Modifies the character’s AC (a bonus lowers AC, a penalty raises it). Missile: Applied to attack rolls (but not damage rolls) with ranged weapons. Initiative: Modifies the character’s initiative roll if the optional rule for individual initiative is used (see Combat). DEX AC Missile Initiative 3 -3 -3 -2 4–5 -2 -2 -1 6–8 -1 -1 -1 9–12 None None None 13–15 +1 +1 +1 16–17 +2 +2 +1 18 +3 +3 +2 Constitution (CON) # Health, stamina, and endurance.\nHit points: Applies when rolling a character’s hit points (i.e., at 1st level and every time a level is gained thereafter). A character always gains at least 1 hit point per Hit Die, regardless of the CON modifier. CON Hit Points 3 -3 4–5 -2 6–8 -1 9–12 None 13–15 +1 16–17 +2 18 +3 Charisma (CHA) # Leadership potential, personal magnetism, and physical appearance.\nNPC reactions: Applies when hiring retainers and when interacting with monsters.

Retainers CHA NPC Reactions Max # Loyalty 3 -2 1 4 4–5 -1 2 5 6–8 -1 3 6 9–12 None 4 7 13–15 +1 5 8 16–17 +1 6 9 18 +2 7 10 Prime Requisite # Each character class has one or more prime requisites—ability scores of particular importance to that class’ function. A character’s score in their prime requisites affects how quickly they gain XP.\nXP modifier: Applied to all XP awarded to characters with a single prime requisite. The modifiers for classes with multiple prime requisites are noted in the class description. Prime Requisite XP Modifier 3–5 -20% 6–8 -10% 9–12 None 13–15 +5% 16–18 +10% Alignment # Alignments are cosmic principles that represent broad worldviews. All beings are categorized under three alignments: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos.\nLaw: The belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the universe. Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.\nNeutrality: The belief in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with neither side becoming dominant. Neutral beings will cooperate with others as long as it is not to their detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated and believe in living by their talents rather than relying on others.\nChaos: The belief in evil and the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe, wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. Chaotic beings lie and use others as is suitable to their own ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws, and are driven by whims and the belief in luck.\nRevealing Alignment # The player must inform the referee of their character’s alignment but does not have to tell other players.\nRole-Playing Alignment # Players should consider the chosen alignment when determining their character’s actions. The referee may call the player’s attention to deeds against the chosen alignment and suggest that the character changes to an alignment better fitting their behavior. Deviation from alignment may also be penalized as the referee sees fit.\nLanguages # The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the character’s class. These typically include the common tongue and an alignment language. Characters with high INT may learn additional languages (see Ability Scores).\nThe Common Tongue # The common tongue (sometimes simply called Common) is a language that is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.\nIn some settings, the referee may rule that different cultures in the campaign world have different languages, in which case a particular language must be chosen instead of Common.\nAlignment Languages # All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their alignment. This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognize when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten.\nOther Languages # Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own language, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence (at the referee’s discretion):\nd20 Language 1 Bugbear 2 Doppelgänger 3 Dragon 4 Dwarvish 5 Elvish 6 Gargoyle 7 Gnoll 8 Gnomish 9 Goblin 10 Halfling 11 Harpy 12 Hobgoblin 13 Kobold 14 Lizard man 15 Medusa 16 Minotaur 17 Ogre 18 Orcish 19 Pixie 20 Human dialect Advancement # Experience # All characters who survive an adventure and return to safety gain experience points (XP) due to any treasure recovered or monsters defeated. Experience points are awarded by the referee (see Awarding XP).\nPrime Requisite Modifiers # Characters with especially low or high scores in their class’ prime requisites receive a bonus or penalty for XP earned (see Ability Scores). These modifiers are applied to the total XP gained by each character following an adventure.\nLevel Up # When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player should consult the description of the character’s class and note any improvements in saving throws, attack probabilities, spells per day, and other class abilities. If the character’s Hit Dice increases, a new Hit Die of the specified type should be rolled, adding the result to the character’s maximum hit point total.\nMaximum XP in One Session # Characters can advance up to one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level is lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level.\nLevel Titles # In some campaigns, characters gain the right to bear specific titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of. Level titles often vary significantly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:\nCleric: Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess), Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Matriarch (Patriarch). Dwarf: Dwarven Veteran, Dwarven Warrior, Dwarven Swordmaster, Dwarven Hero, Dwarven Swashbuckler, Dwarven Myrmidon, Dwarven Champion, Dwarven Superhero, Dwarven Lord (Lady). Elf: Medium/Veteran, Seer/Warrior, Conjurer/Swordmaster, Magician/Hero, Enchanter (Enchantress)/Swashbuckler, Warlock (Witch)/Myrmidon, Sorcerer (Sorceress)/Champion, Necromancer/Superhero, Wizard/Lord (Lady). Fighter: Veteran, Warrior, Swordmaster, Hero, Swashbuckler, Myrmidon, Champion, Superhero, Lord (Lady). Halfling: Halfling Veteran, Halfling Warrior, Halfling Swordmaster, Halfling Hero, Halfling Swashbuckler, Halfling Myrmidon, Halfling Champion, Sheriff. Magic-user: Medium, Seer, Conjurer, Magician, Enchanter (Enchantress), Warlock (Witch), Sorcerer (Sorceress), Necromancer, Wizard. Thief: Apprentice, Footpad, Robber, Burglar, Cutpurse, Sharper, Pilferer, Thief, Master Thief. High-Level Play (Optional Rule) # Human character classes are listed as having a maximum level of 14. This range of levels presents the best play experience regarding challenge and reward. However, some groups may wish to continue playing at extremely high levels. This must be considered carefully, as demihuman PCs will be left behind due to their strict level limits. If the referee allows continued play into higher levels, the following guidelines—allowing human characters to advance to a maximum of 36th level—may be used.\nClerics # Clerics require an additional 100,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.\nFighters # Fighters require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained.

Unseaworthy vessels are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.\nDamaging Vehicles # In combat, attacks and damage may be directed at vehicles, characters, and monsters.\nNormal attacks: Unless noted in a vehicle’s description, attacks with normal weapons (e.g., bows, swords, etc.) do not inflict hull damage.\nMagical attacks: Damaging spells or magical attacks inflict one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.\nGiant monsters: Can damage vehicles, inflicting one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit-point damage the attack does.\nMounted weaponry: Some vehicles carry mounted weaponry specifically designed for vehicle-to-vehicle combat. Such weapons inflict hull damage directly. The rules for attacking with ship-mounted weapons are described in Water Vessels.\nEffects of Hull Damage # When a vehicle loses hull points, its movement rate is also affected. This may be due to structural damage influencing how the vehicle moves or, in the case of water vessels, due to taking on water.\nMovement rate reduction: For every 10% a vehicle is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement rate is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if a vehicle loses 20% of its hull points, its movement rate is reduced by 20%.\nDestruction # If a vehicle is reduced to 0 hull points:\nIt will lose structural integrity in 1d10 rounds (e.g., a water vessel sinks). Any mounted weaponry is no longer functional. Repairs # In a workshop: Vehicle damage can be repaired by experienced technicians working in a suitable workshop or dock.\nIn the field: A vehicle’s crew can repair up to half of sustained damage. The remaining damage can only be repaired in a suitable workshop or dock.\nTime: It takes five crew members one turn to repair one hull point. This task requires full attention, so any crew involved in repair cannot take any other action during a turn repairing a vessel.\nBoarding # When the occupants of a vehicle wish to board another vehicle, the two vehicles must be brought alongside one another.\nForceful boarding: If the occupants of one vehicle wish to board the other vehicle forcefully, there is a 2-in-6 chance of successfully maneuvering the vehicle into a boarding position. The two vehicles may then be clamped together with grappling hooks.\nMutual boarding intent: If the occupants of both vehicles wish to board one another, their mutual goal makes the action succeed with no chance of failure.\nBoarding characters: Characters who are in the act of boarding another vehicle suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class for one round.\nRowed Water Vessels # Rowing Encounter Speeds # Some rowed vessels may have an increased encounter movement rate. This represents the tremendous effort of the oarsmen that may be exerted during combat. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods; thus, such vessels\u0026rsquo; per-turn and per-day movement rates are much slower.\nReduced Oarsmen # Having less than the required number of oarsmen reduces a vessel’s speed.\nMovement rate reduction: For every 10% reduction in the available rowing crew, the vessel’s rowing speed is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if 10% of the oarsmen are used to repair hull damage, the vessel moves at 90% of its normal speed (i.e., 10% slower than normal).\nLand Vehicles # Vehicle Cost (gp) Miles per Day Movement Rate Minimum Animals Max Load (Coins) Extra Animals Max Load (Coins) Cart 100 12 60’ (20’) 1 draft horse or 2 mules 4,000 2 draft horses or 4 mules 8,000 Wagon 200 12 60’ (20’) 2 draft horses or 4 mules 15,000 4 draft horses or 8 mules 25,000 Cart: A two-wheeled vehicle. Carts have an AC of 9 [10] and 1d4 hull points.\nWagon: A four-wheeled, open vehicle. Wagons have an AC of 9 [10] and 2d4 hull points.\nRequired Animals # These vehicles must be pulled by a minimum number of mules or draft horses. If double the minimum number of animals is employed, additional loads may be carried.\nDifficult Terrain # When traveling through difficult terrain (e.g. desert, forest, mountains, swamp), these vehicles can only travel on maintained roads.\nWater Vessels # Vessel Dimensions # A ship’s beam is its width, and its draft is the depth it extends beneath the water.\nHistorical Periods # The vessels described in this section span various historical periods, from the ancient period to the medieval. Not all types of vessels may be available in a campaign setting.\nSeaworthy Vessels # Vessel Cost (gp) Cargo Capacity (Coins) Usage Length Beam Draft Lifeboat 1,000 15,000 Any 20’ 4’–5’ 1’–2’ Longship 15,000 40,000 Any 60’–80’ 10’–15’ 2’–3’ Sailing ship (large) 20,000 300,000 Coastal waters, open seas 100’–150’ 25’–30’ 10’–12’ Sailing ship (small) 5,000 100,000 Coastal waters, open seas 60’–80’ 20’–30’ 5’–8’ Troop transport (large) 26,600 300,000 Coastal waters, open seas 100’–150’ 25’–30’ 10’–12’ Troop transport (small) 6,600 100,000 Coastal waters, open seas 60’–80’ 20’–30’ 5’–8’ Warship (large) 26,600 300,000 Coastal waters, open seas 100’–150’ 25’–30’ 10’–12’ Warship (small) 6,600 100,000 Coastal waters, open seas 60’–80’ 20’–30’ 5’–8’ Descriptions # Lifeboat: A small boat with a mast that folds down for storage. Small ships usually have 1–2 lifeboats, while larger ships may have 3–4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the ship\u0026rsquo;s cargo capacity on which it is carried by this much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with rations to feed ten human-sized beings for one week.\nLongship: A narrow ship that may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fills the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters as needed.\nSailing ship, large: A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually, it has multiple decks and raised “castles” at the bow and stern.\nSailing ship, small: A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.\nTroop transport (large, small): These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships but are specially designed to carry troops, mounts, and equipment of war as their cargo.\nWarship (large, small): These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships but are specially designed to carry mercenaries and war gear.\nUnseaworthy Vessels # Vessel Cost (gp) Cargo Capacity (Coins) Usage Length Beam Draft Boat (river) 4,000 30,000 Rivers, lakes 20’–30’ 10’ 2’–3’ Boat (sailing) 2,000 20,000 Lakes, coastal waters 20’–40’ 10’–15’ 2’–3’ Canoe 50 6,000 Rivers, swamps 15’ 3’ 1’ Galley (large) 30,000 40,000 Coastal waters 120’–150’ 15’–20’ 3’ Galley (small) 10,000 20,000 Coastal waters 60’–100’ 10’–15’ 2’–3’ Galley (war) 60,000 60,000 Coastal waters 120’–150’ 20’–30’ 4’–6’ Raft (makeshift) — 50 per square foot Rivers, lakes Varies Varies ½’ Raft (professional) 1gp per square foot 100 per square foot Rivers, lakes Varies Varies ½’ Descriptions # Boat, river: Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat increases by 1,000gp if it has a roof (to protect passengers or cargo).\nBoat, sailing: A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.\nCanoe: A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).\nGalley, large: A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.\nGalley, small: A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.\nGalley, war: A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet’s flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.\nRaft, makeshift: Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a maximum size of 20’ × 30’).\nRaft, professional: A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ × 40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).\nVessel Movement and Crew # Rowing (Oarsmen) Sailing (Sailors) Vessel Requires Captain?

The modification costs one-third of the ship’s original cost. Catapult: A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship. Ram: A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already has a ram fitted). Ship Weaponry # Item Cost (gp) Catapult 100 Catapult shot 5 Catapult shot, pitch 25 Ram, large galley 10,000 Ram, small galley 3,000 Rams # It can be used against ships or giant sea monsters. Small individuals cannot be targeted.\nAttack rolls: These are made using a THAC0 of 19 [0], occurring simultaneously in the combat sequence as missile fire.\nAttack modifiers: May be applied for weather conditions, maneuverability, etc.\nLarge or war galley: Deals 1d6+5 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.\nSmall galley: Deals 1d4+4 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.\nCatapults # Fire either large rocks or flaming pitch.\nWeight: A catapult plus twenty shot rounds weighs 10,000 coins (subtracted from the ship’s cargo allowance).\nRange: 150–300 yards.\nAttack rolls and rate of fire: Depend on the number of crew manning the catapult:\n2 crew (minimum): Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 10 rounds. 3 crew: Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 8 rounds. 4 crew (maximum): Attacks with THAC0 17 [+2]. Fires every 5 rounds. Attack modifiers: May be applied for weather conditions, maneuverability, etc.\nCatapult Shot # Inflicts 3d6 hull damage against ships.\nCatapult Shot, Pitch # Sets a 10’×10’ area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten in 2 turns, or fifteen in 1 turn.\nRetainers # Retainers are NPCs hired to accompany a character on adventures.\nLimit per PC: A character’s Charisma score defines the maximum number of retainers that will work for them at any one time (see Ability Scores).\nDuties: Retainers are expected to share the risks of adventuring with the party but will only continue working for a PC if treated well. A disgruntled retainer may spread the word to others in the area, making hiring other retainers more difficult for the PC.\nClass and Level # Retainers can be of any class (including normal humans—effectively of level 0), but must be of equal or lower level to the hiring PC.\nRecruitment # Potential retainers may be located by frequenting drinking establishments or by paying to post notices of help wanted.\nApplicants are recruited through negotiation, with the referee playing the roles of the NPCs a character attempts to hire. The PC should explain what the job entails and the wages paid.\nWages and Upkeep # The referee should determine the rate of pay desired by potential retainers, taking the following factors into account:\nSkill level: More experienced retainers will want a higher pay rate, whereas those employed for unskilled tasks will have lower demands. Competition: Retainers may accept lower pay rates if there are many applicants but may demand higher rates if there is little competition for the job. Standard Rate # Retainers usually want a guaranteed fee (per day or adventure) and a share of treasure recovered (at least a half share). For example: a cost of 1gp per day plus a half share of treasure.\nUpkeep # The hiring PC must also pay for the retainer’s daily upkeep (food and lodgings) and any new adventuring gear, weapons, or mounts the retainer requires.\nShares of Treasure # Fractional treasure shares are calculated by dividing the treasure by the total number of shares. For example, a party consisting of 5 PCs (who receive full shares) plus one retainer (who is paid a half share) discovers 2,750gp of treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five full shares plus one-half share): 500gp. Thus, each PC gains 500gp, and the retainer gains 250gp.\nApplicant Reactions # Once an offer is made, the referee determines the potential retainer’s reaction by rolling 2d6 on the table below, modified as follows:\nCharisma: The roll is modified by the hiring character’s NPC reactions modifier due to CHA (see ***Ability Scores. Generosity: The referee may apply a bonus or penalty, depending on the attractiveness of the deal (+1 or +2 for generous offers, -1 or -2 for poor offers). Reputation: A penalty of -1 or -2 may be applied if the hiring PC has a bad reputation. 2d6 Result 2 or less Ill will 3–5 Offer refused 6–8 Roll again 9–11 Offer accepted 12 or more Offer accepted, +1 loyalty Ill will: The applicant’s ill will incur a –1 penalty to further hiring reaction rolls made in the same settlement or area.\nExperience # Retainers gain experience and advance in level in the same way as PCs.\nXP penalty: Because retainers are generally not directly involved in decision-making, instead following instructions from PCs, the XP they receive is penalized by –50%.\nNormal humans: When a normal human (i.e., a retainer of level 0 with no character class) gains XP, they must choose an adventuring character class.\nLoyalty # A retainer’s loyalty rating reflects their willingness to stick by PCs in the face of danger. The hiring character’s CHA determines loyalty (see Ability Scores) but may be adjusted as follows:\nBonuses: Saving a retainer from danger or granting generous treasure rewards may increase loyalty. Penalties: Ill-treatment of a retainer or lack of treasure may decrease loyalty. Loyalty Checks # The referee should roll 2d6 against the retainer’s loyalty to make a loyalty check. The check succeeds if the roll is lower than or equal to the retainer’s loyalty.\nWhen to Check Loyalty # Loyalty checks are made in two circumstances:\nPeril: In situations of unexpectedly great danger. If the roll fails, the retainer will likely flee. After an adventure: If the roll fails, the retainer will not work for the PC again. Mercenaries # Hired soldiers who will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. Mercenaries do not accompany characters on adventures.\nNote that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.\nLocating Mercenaries # Mercenaries can be located by posting notices of help wanted. The response will depend on the availability of suitable troops in the area and the offer made.\nWages # Outside of wartime: As listed below.\nDuring wartime: All wages are doubled.\nUpkeep # The monthly rate of pay includes food and essential gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armor when hired, though their employer may give them additional equipment. Armorers are required to repair mercenaries’ armor and weapons (see Specialists).\nWage per Month Type AC Morale Human Dwarf Elf Orc Goblin Archer 6 [13] 8 5gp — 10gp 3gp 2gp Archer, mounted 9 [10] 9 15gp — 30gp — — Crossbowman 5 [14] 8 4gp 6gp — 2gp — Crossbowman, mounted 9 [10] 9 — 15gp — — — Footman, light 6 [13] 8 2gp — 4gp 1gp 5sp Footman, heavy 4 [15] 8 3gp 5gp 6gp 15sp — Horseman, light 7 [12] 9 10gp — 20gp — — Horseman, medium 5 [14] 9 15gp — — — — Horseman, heavy 3 [16] 9 20gp — — — — Longbowman 5 [14] 8 10gp — 20gp — — Peasant 9 [10] 6 1gp — — — — Wolf rider 7 [12] 9 — — — — 5gp Archer # Equipped with a shortbow, leather armor, and a shield.\nArcher, Mounted # Mounted on a riding horse.

Unlike retainers, there is no limit on the number of specialists a character may employ.\nThe most common types of specialists and their usual monthly wage are described. The referee may add new types of specialists as desired.\nLocating Specialists # Specialists can be located by posting notices or inquiring at suitable guilds. The response will depend on the availability of suitable specialists in the area and the offer made.\nWages and Upkeep # The monthly rate of pay includes food and essential gear.\nSpecialist Wage per Month Alchemist 1,000gp Animal trainer 500gp Armorer 100gp Assistant armorer 15gp Blacksmith 25gp Engineer 750gp Navigator 150gp Oarsman 2gp Sage 2,000gp Sailor 10gp Ship’s captain 250gp Spy 500gp (or more) Alchemist # Recreating potions: Based on a sample or recipe, an alchemist can produce a potion at twice the normal speed and for half the normal cost (see Magical Research).\nResearching potions: An alchemist may also research new potions, but this takes twice as long and costs twice as much as normal.\nAnimal Trainer # Trainers are required for exotic creatures or larger numbers of common animals (e.g., dogs, horses, mules).\nSpecialty: Each animal trainer specializes in a single type of animal.\nNumber of animals: A trainer can work with up to 6 animals at a time.\nTime required: The referee decides the time required to train an animal, depending on the difficulty of the training and the animal’s intelligence. Learning the first new behavior or trick typically takes at least one month. Subsequent behaviors take at least two weeks each.\nInterruptions: Training of all desired behaviors must occur back to back. If interrupted, the animal becomes unable to learn further behaviors.\nArmorer # Producing weapons and armor: An armorer can produce five weapons, three shields, or one suit of armor per month.\nMaintaining mercenaries’ gear: A dedicated armorer is required per 50 troops.\nAssistants: An armorer’s output (either in arms produced or troops maintained) may be doubled by hiring two assistant armorers and one blacksmith. The armorer\u0026rsquo;s production may be quadrupled if four assistants and two blacksmiths are hired. An armorer cannot coordinate more assistants than this.\nAssistant Armorer # Apprentices who may work under an armorer to increase the production rate (see Armorer).\nBlacksmith # Craftsmen trained in the art of forging metal. Blacksmiths may be hired to work under an armorer to increase the rate of production (see Armorer).\nEngineer # Engineers are experts in planning and managing construction projects, for example, building strongholds (see Construction).\nNumber required: One engineer is needed per 100,000 gp cost of the project.\nSpecialty: Certain races may have special expertise (e.g., a dwarf engineer may specialize in subterranean construction).\nNavigator # Experts in navigating the high seas. A ship that travels beyond sight of land becomes lost if a navigator is not aboard (see Waterborne Adventuring).\nOarsman # Normal humans employed to power rowed ships; not trained for combat.\nSage # Sages are very rare individuals who devote their lives to studying obscure knowledge. A sage may be consulted to answer unusual questions.\nTime and cost: The referee must judge the time and cost required to research the answer to a question.\nChance of success: There is never a 100% chance of finding an answer.\nSailor # Normal humans trained in the handling of sailing ships. Sailors can fight to defend their ships, typically equipped with a sword, shield, and leather armor.\nShip’s Captain # A seasoned sailor required to command a larger ship. A captain is familiar with the waters around the coasts they frequent.\nSpy # A spy is hired to gather information about a person or group. The spy may be an outsider trying to infiltrate or a traitor already connected with the person or group to be spied upon.\nClass: Spies are often NPC thieves but may be of any character class.\nTime: The referee will determine the time required for the job.\nChance of success: Based on the circumstances, the referee judges the chance of the mission succeeding.\nReliability: The referee may also secretly decide a chance of the spy betraying the character.\nStrongholds # Construction # When PCs wish to construct strongholds or any other type of building, the following procedure should be used:\nPermission: It may be necessary to secure permission to build from an existing authority over the land. This may not be required if the land is uncharted wilderness. Clear land: If the construction site is in the wilderness, all monsters in a 6-mile area (i.e., one hex on a typical small-scale wilderness map) must be killed or driven off. Design: The player creates a plan for the stronghold and calculates the costs (see construction prices in Structures. Review: The referee should review and approve the player’s plans. Hire engineers: For every 100,000gp cost of the stronghold, the PC must hire one engineer (see Specialists). Construction: Construction may commence once the land has been cleared and construction materials delivered. The time required depends entirely on the stronghold’s total price: one day of game time per 500 gp. Prepare for settlers: If the PC wishes to find a dominion and attract settlers, a wider area around the stronghold should be cleared of dangers. Building in Towns # Permission: While local rulers may allow PCs to build in a town, it is unlikely that they will grant permission to construct castles or fortifications.\nCosts: When building in an existing town or city, the proximity of materials and labor dramatically reduces the costs.\nStone buildings: Reduced by 60%.\nWooden buildings: Reduced by 80%.\nDomain Management # Maintaining Cleared Lands # Mercenaries may be hired to conduct patrols to prevent monsters from returning to cleared lands. These patrols can cover a maximum radius of 18 miles around a stronghold (6 miles in inhospitable terrain such as swamps, mountains, or thick jungle). If the area to be maintained is larger, additional garrisons must be stationed at intervals.\nSettlers # The PC may wish to attract settlers into a cleared area. In addition to ensuring the safety of surrounding lands, the character will have to fund the construction of other buildings (e.g., accommodation, commercial facilities, transport infrastructure, etc.) to attract settlers. Advertising may also be necessary. The referee will determine the costs involved and how many settlers are attracted.\nTaxation # If settlers move into the PC’s domain, the character can expect to gain 10 gp of taxes per year from each settler.\nStructures # Structure Cost Barbican 37,000 gp Bastion 9,000 gp Civilian building, stone 3,000 gp Civilian building, wood 1,500 gp Drawbridge 500 gp Gatehouse 6,500 gp Keep 75,000 gp Moat 400 gp Subterranean passage 500 gp Tower, large 30,000 gp Tower, small 15,000 gp Wall, castle 5,000 gp Descriptions # Barbican: Heavily fortified entry/exit point in a castle wall: two small towers, a gatehouse, and a drawbridge.\nBastion: Semi-circular tower built against a castle wall. 30’ base, 30’ high, walls 5’ thick.\nCivilian building, stone: Two levels; wooden stairs, doors, floors, and roof; attic.

Use the guidelines for towers, below, and divide by two.\nCastle Walls # Higher castle walls may be constructed at an increased cost. A 100’ length of 30’ high wall costs 7,500 gp. Every additional 10’ height beyond this (up to a maximum of 60’ tall) costs 5,000 gp.\nTowers # Towers of dimensions other than those listed may be constructed. The cost is determined by the tower\u0026rsquo;s height and its base\u0026rsquo;s diameter (in feet).\nMaximum height: Twice the base diameter. Up to the base diameter: Each 10’ height costs 200 gp × the base diameter. Above the base diameter: Each 10’ height costs 400 gp × the base diameter. Example Tower Cost Calculation # A 60’ high tower with a 40’ diameter base will be constructed.\nThe cost will be 8,000 gp (40 × 200 gp) per 10’ for the first 40’ of height and 16,000 gp (40 × 400 gp) per 10’ for the remainder of the height.\nThe total cost is thus (8,000 gp × 4) + (16,000 gp × 2) = 64,000 gp.\nInterior Features # The common interior features of a stronghold are listed in the table below.\nSimple Approach # For simplicity, the cost of a stronghold may be increased by 25% to account for interior details, including: reinforced doors, stone stairs, flagstone flooring, tile roofing, windows or arrow slits, bars and shutters on windows, and standard furnishings.\nDetailed Approach # The table below may be consulted if the group wishes to perform more detailed calculations or if additional features are desired.\nDetail Dimensions Cost (gp) Arrow slit — 10 Door, iron 3’ wide, 7’ tall 50 Door, reinforced wood 3’ wide, 7’ tall 20 Door, stone 3’ wide, 7’ tall 50 Door, wood 3’ wide, 7’ tall 10 Floor, flagstones or tiles 10’×10’ section 100 Floor, wood 10’×10’ section 40 Roof, tiled 10’×10’ section 100 Roof, wood 10’×10’ section 40 Secret door or trapdoor Normal 5 × normal Shifting wall 10’×10’ section 1,000 Stairs, stone 3’ wide, 10’ long section 60 Stairs, wooden 3’ wide, 10’ long section 20 Trapdoor, iron 4’×3’ 120 Trapdoor, reinforced wood 4’×3’ 40 Trapdoor, stone 4’×3’ 120 Trapdoor, wood 4’×3’ 20 Window — 10 Window bars — 10 Window shutters — 5 "},{"id":6,"href":"/thievery/players-guide/magic/","title":"Magic: Thievery! Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Rules of Magic # Some character classes can memorize and cast magical spells. A spell consists of a pattern of magical energy memorized in a character’s mind. When a spell is cast, the spell is erased from the character’s mind until it is memorized again.\nArcane and divine magic: Spells are either granted by a deity or higher power (divine magic) or learned by esoteric study (arcane magic).\nSpell list: The character’s class determines which spells they can cast. Each class has an associated list of spells.\nSpells in memory: The character’s level determines how many spells they can memorize at one time.\nReversible spells: As indicated in each spell’s description, some spells are reversible.\nMemorizing Spells # Rest and time requirements: A spellcaster can memorize new spells after an uninterrupted night’s sleep. It takes one hour to memorize all the spells the character is capable of.\nDuplicate spells: A character may memorize the same spell more than once if they can learn more than one spell of the given level.\nCasting Spells # A memorized spell may be cast by precisely replicating the required hand gestures and mystical spoken words.\nOnce only: When a spell is cast, knowledge of the spell is erased from the caster\u0026rsquo;s mind until it is memorized again.\nFreedom: The character must be able to speak and move their hands. A spellcaster cannot cast spells if gagged, bound, or in an area of magical silence.\nLine of sight: Unless noted in a spell’s description, the intended target (a specific monster, character, object, or area of effect) must be visible to the caster.\nSpell Effects # Selecting targets: Some spells affect multiple targets by area or Hit Dice total. If the spell description does not specify how targets are chosen, the referee must decide whether they are selected randomly, by the caster, etc.\nConcentration: Some spells specify that the caster must concentrate to maintain the magical effect. Unless the spell description states otherwise, performing any other action or being distracted (e.g., attacked) causes concentration to end.\nCumulative effects: Multiple spells cannot increase the same ability (e.g., bonuses to attack rolls, AC, damage rolls, saving throws, etc.). Spells that affect different abilities can be combined. Spells can be combined with the effects of magical items.\nArcane Magic # Memorizing Spells # Arcane spell casters memorize spells from spell books (see Spell Books) and are thus limited to choosing from the spells in their spell book, which must be at hand.\nReversing Spells # A spell\u0026rsquo;s normal or reversed form must be selected when memorized. An arcane spellcaster may memorize both forms of a spell if the character can memorize more than one spell of the given level.\nDivine Magic # Memorizing Spells # Divine spell casters memorize spells through prayer to their gods. When praying for spells, divine spell casters may choose any spells in their class’ spell list that they are of high enough level to cast.\nReversing Spells # Divine spell casters can cast the reversed version of a spell by speaking the words and performing the gestures backward when cast.\nDeity Disfavour # Divine spell casters must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and religion. If the character ever falls from favor with their deity, penalties (determined by the referee) may be imposed. These may include penalties to attack (-1), a reduction in spells, or being sent on a perilous quest. To regain favor, the character must perform some great deed for their deity (as determined by the referee), for example, donating magic items or gold, constructing a temple, converting many people to the religion, defeating a powerful enemy of the deity, etc.\nSpells and Deity Alignment # A divine spellcaster may draw disfavor from their deity when casting spells (or their reversed versions) whose effects go against the deity’s alignment:\nLawful characters: Will only use reversed spells in dire circumstances. Chaotic characters: Will usually use reversed spells, only using the normal versions of spells to benefit allies of their religion. Neutral characters: Will favor either normal or reversed spells, depending on the deity served (no deity favors both reversed and normal spells). Note: Entry included from Spells.\nSpell Books # Arcane spell casters record the spells that they know in a spell book.\nNumber of spells: A character’s spell book contains exactly the number of spells the character can memorize (as determined by the character’s class and level).\nBeginning Spells # Arcane spell casters begin with as many spells in their spell book as they can memorize. The referee may choose these spells or may allow the player to select them.\nAdding Spells # When the number of spells an arcane spellcaster can memorize increases (e.g., by gaining an experience level), they can increase the selection of spells in their spell book. In this way, the number of spells in the spell book may be brought in line with the number of spells the character can memorize. This is possible in two ways:\nMentoring: The character may consult an arcane guild or mentor to learn new spells. This process takes about a week of game time. The spells a character learns in this way are determined by the referee, who may decide to let the player choose. Research: It is also possible to add spells to a spell book using Magical Research. Lost Spell Books # An arcane spellcaster can rewrite the spells in a lost or destroyed spell book:\nCost: The cost per spell to be recovered is one week of game time and 1,000gp per spell level. For instance, rewriting two 1st-level and one 2nd-level spells will take four weeks and 4,000 gp. Sole activity: This activity requires complete concentration. The character may not engage in any other activity for the required period. Captured Spell Books # Each arcane spell caster’s spell books are written so that only the owner can read the spells without magic.\nCleric Spells # If a spell can be reversed (see Spells), the name of the reversed version is noted in parentheses.\n1st Level # Cure Light Wounds (Cause Lt.

Referee's Guide","section":"Thievery! Referee's Guide","content":" Magical Research # Many spell-casting character classes can also perform research into new spells, magic items, and other magical effects, as noted in the class description. This requires time, monetary outlay, and sometimes rare and unusual ingredients.\nChance of Failure # All forms of magical research have a minimum 15% chance of failure. If the research fails, the money and time invested are lost.\nCreating New Spells # The player must write up the spell they wish to create and show the referee. The referee then decides what level the spell will be and may request changes (or deem the magic impossible to research).\nRestrictions # The character can only research spells of a level they can cast.\nCost and Time # Researching a new spell takes two weeks per spell level and 1,000 gp per spell level.\nCreating Magic Items # The player must write up the item they wish to create and show the referee. The referee then decides what materials are required and may request changes (or deem the item impossible to research).\nRestrictions # Divine spell casters: May only create items they can use themselves.\nArcane spell casters: May create any item except those that may only be used by divine spell casters.\nMaterials # Creating magic items often requires rare components such as expensive gems or body parts of monsters or rare animals. Often, adventures will be necessary to acquire these materials.\nCost and Time # Duplicating spell effects: Single-use items (e.g., scrolls, potions) that recreate the effects of a spell cost one week per spell level and 500gp per spell level.\nMulti-use items: If the item created can replicate a spell effect multiple times (for example, a wand with charges), the cost in time and money is multiplied by the number of uses.\nOther items: The referee must judge the requirements for creating items that do not recreate the effects of a spell. More powerful items should require more time, money, and special materials or quests. Some examples: 20 arrows +1 (10,000 gp, one month), plate mail +1 (10,000 gp, six months), crystal ball (30,000 gp, six months), ring of x-ray vision (100,000 gp, one year).\nOther Magical Research # Characters who can research spells or magic items may also attempt to research other magical processes. For example, a character may wish to sanctify a holy site or create magical traps, constructs, or portals.\nAs with magic item creation, the referee decides the time and cost of the research. The following may also be required:\nThe casting of certain, specific spells. Rare ingredients. Sometimes, it may also be necessary to repeat the ritual to renew the magical effect periodically. "},{"id":8,"href":"/scape/","title":"Scape","section":"Sean Wolcott","content":" Scape # A fantasy roleplaying game for the Planescape setting.\nCentral Tenets of Scape # Player characters are not superheroes. They are denizens of the planes just like everyone else. What separates them from the rest is their choices. Even mighty heores can fall to a single stroke of a weapon. Mortals are mortal. They are fragile. Even the mighty Achilles or Ajax is slain with a single arrow or spear stroke. The trick is to avoid getting hit, or even better avoid letting anyone want to hit you in the first place. Roleplay is not about combat, narrative, numbers, nor personality, but about choices. The important things that happen are the ways the player characters affect the world around them. Character growth is not a growth in numbers. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect STR or HP to alter dramatically. Expect a growth in what you are capable of. Ideas and extraordinary abliities are represented as items. Among the planes, the abstract tends to be represented as the physical. Your character\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; is the items that give them abilities. Your level up abilities are tattoos you collect. Even your XP is represented as chips, to be traded and spent. The referee is there to challege the characters\u0026rsquo; viewpoints as much as their safety. This is more about perspective and philosophy than it is about killing monsters. The strange creatures are to be feared for their ideas more than fang and claw. Rules are for skipping ahead in time. We don\u0026rsquo;t include rules for the important parts of the game: choices, ethics, planar travel. That\u0026rsquo;s because we want you to take your time on those areas and explore them fully through roleplay and a dialogue between each other and the referee. We include rules for parts we want to get over quickly: combat, skill checks, powers, even making characters and leveling up. We made them simple and quick so they can make room for the important parts. Similarly, saves made out of combat are for skipping past unimportant bits. Character Creation # Roll 3d6. This is your max STR score. Roll 3d6. This is your max DEX score. Roll 3d6. This is your max WIL score. Record your STR, DEX and WIL edge as 0. Roll 1d6. This is your max HP. Add 3 days' rations to your inventory. This takes only one equipment slot. Pick a starting equipment set. Add these to your inventory. Record your worn items and your weapon damage. Record your AC based on your worn armor. Roll 3d6. This is your starting jink. Write a sentence or two about your character\u0026rsquo;s profession before heading out to adventure the planes. Pick a name. Rules # Basic interaction Describe your actions to the referee. They will decide if you succeed or fail. They may ask you to roll a save to determine success. Ability scores You have three ability scores. They act as hit points. They start as the same value as your max ability scores, and may not exceed the max. Applying effort, using special equipment, or taking damage while critically injured can result in lowering your ability scores. If your WIL score reaches 0, you are stupefied until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain 1 fatigue. If your DEX score reaches 0, you are immobilized until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain 1 fatigue. If your STR score reaches 0, you are dead. Forever. Saves To avoid a negative effect, roll 1d20. If the number is less than or equal to your relevant ability, you succeed. Advantage/Disadvantage If an action is particularly easy, the referee may request a roll be made with advantage, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the more favorable roll. Conversely, if an action is particularly difficult, the referee may request a roll be made with disadvantage, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the less favorable roll. Effort A player may turn a roll with disadvantage into a normal roll, or turn a normal roll into a roll with advantage, by applying effort. Applying effort gives the ability score for that roll 3 damage after the effect of the roll is applied. A player can only apply effort once per roll. Edge Activating ability in equipment or applying effort will lower ability scores by a fixed cost. Having an edge decreases the cost by the amount of edge for that ability score. For example, if an ability costs 3 STR, and your STR edge is 1, you lose 2 STR to use that ability. The minimum cost is 0. Profession If the referee determines that the character\u0026rsquo;s profession would result in them being more skilled than usual at that task, the player may assume a minimum edge of 1 for effort applied to that action. AC and HP Any damage received is first reduced by your AC score. If AC cannot reduce it to 0, then the remainder is taken from your HP. Once HP is 0, the remaining damage dealt is taken from the relevant ability score. Physical damage reduces STR, while other effects like magic or poisons may affect DEX or WIL instead. Critical Damage The moment your HP reaches 0 as a result of taking damage, roll a STR save. On a failure, you gain 1 fatigue, you are disabled and can only moan for help and try to crawl to safety. Equipment Slots You have 10 equipment slots to start, 4 of which are considered to be worn or carried. Each piece of equipment you take with you (except coins) takes up equipment slots. Most equipment takes up 1 slot. Small items can be grouped into a single slot. Bulky items use 2 slots. If you have no unused equipment slots, you cannot carry any more equipment and are considered deprived. Carrying a person is considered bulky. Equipment abilities can only be activated while wearing or carrying them. Fatigue You may gain fatigue from various sources such as extreme heat or cold, multiple days without sleep, critical damage, or being downed from ability score damage. Each point of fatigue gained renders a single inventory slot unusable. If this leaves you with no usable inventory slots, you are fatigued. If you have more items equipped than you have usable slots, you must drop the remaining equipment. A full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink removes 1 fatigue. Deprivation Extreme environments, magical effects, and having all usable equipment slots filled causes you to be deprived. While deprived, you cannot restore HP, STR, DEX, nor WIL by resting. Healing Resting allows damage to be recovered to the max score. HP can be restored with a few minutes of rest. STR, DEX, and WIL need a full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink to be restored. Temporary injuries can only have their effects removed with a week of bedrest and a skilled healer. Combat # When combat starts, the game gets a little more structured. Combat happens in the following sequence:\nRoll initiative Everyone makes a DEX save. Surprise Turn Everyone who passed the save takes their turn. Morale Referee rolls to see if the characters under their control flee. Enemy Turn Characters under referee control take their turn. Party Turn Everyone who failed the save takes their turn. End of Round If combat is still ongoing, go to step 1. On a turn # Each character on their turn gets to move and perform an action.\nActions include, but are not limited to:\nAttack If the enemy is within range of the weapon, the attack succeeds. Roll the damage indicated by the weapon. Unarmed Attack If the enemy is within reach, the attack succeeds. The enemy takes 1 damage. Use Equipment They may use the equipment at a tool, or an improvsied weapon, or may activate an ability the equipment gives them. They do so by wearing or holding the equipment as appropriate. Merely carrying it (such as in a backpack) is not sufficient. Interact They may push a button, open a door, roll a barrel, or interact with any other reachable object in their environment. Improvise They may try to do anything else that the character can think of that\u0026rsquo;s capable of being done in a few seconds. The referee determines the outcome. Morale # Each round the referee makes a determination on whether the creatures flee and end the combat. This can be done \u0026ldquo;by feel\u0026rdquo;, or by doing the following procedure.\nRoll a WIL save on behalf of the creatures. One save for the entire group. If they are especially cowardly creatures, or have lost half their group, the roll with disadvantage. If they have an experienced leader, they roll with advantage. If they fail, they attempt to flee and combat is ended. Character Advancement # Experience # XP is gained for attaining goals, discovering new places, and making critical decisions. XP is represented as poker chips. 1 XP is given to each player in a group when the group as a whole is being rewarded. If a single player is being rewarded, the referee gives 2 XP to the player: 1 XP the player keeps for themself, 1 XP is given to another player while stating a reason they deserve it. XP can be traded freely among players. XP can also be spent to \u0026ldquo;grease the wheels\u0026rdquo; of roleplaying, obtaining some minor goal without having to roleplay it or risk failure. Doing so costs the party 4XP.\nXP can be spent to reverse the effects of a bad roll. The player may choose to surrender 1 XP to the referee after failing the save, and avoids whatever the most recent roll\u0026rsquo;s bad effect as if it never happened.\nXP can also be spent to make the character stronger by purchasing tattoos. A player can spend 4 XP to gain any one of the following tattoos. A player may not take a particular tattoo if it was one of their 3 most recently purchased tattoos. That means at most the same tattoo can only be gained for every 4 tattoo purchases.\nTattoos # Mark of Vitality: This tattoo causes you to grow grotesquely muscly. You can perform great feats of strength more often, but maybe you should refrain from delicate tasks like petting kittens. Increase your STR edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Agility: This tattoo causes you to be quicker and more twitchy. Your reflexes are enchanced. Never mind the occasional spasms. That\u0026rsquo;s just your nervous system going into overdrive. Increase your DEX edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Intellect: With this mark your neural pathways have opened and you can see the connections you couldn\u0026rsquo;t before. Also, does anyone else see all the eyes everywhere? Increase your WIL edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Health: You can dodge so well with this mark that time seems to move a bit slower for you. You\u0026rsquo;re not sure why everyone keeps complaining about you talking so fast. Increase max HP by 2. Mark of Burden: Life is a tetris game. You can see the optimal packing for your stuff. And how to optimally pack everything else, all the time. Increase your number of inventory slots by 1, not to exceed 14. Mark of Skill: Multitasking is what it\u0026rsquo;s all about. You can hold so many things at once. Juggling seems trivial now. You know because you never stop doing it. Increase the number of inventory slots which can be worn or carried by 1, not to exceed 6. Mark of Toughness: Your favorite set of armor is so broken in and perfectly molded to your form that it feels like another layer of skin. That\u0026rsquo;s why it feels like you\u0026rsquo;re ripping your skin off whenever you remove it. Choose one armor type. Increase the AC of that armor type by 1 when you wear it. You may only select this tattoo once. Mark of Arcana: You just got your favorite scroll tattooed right on your skin so now it lives rent-free in your brain, pushing out some core memories that lived there. If you could remember what it was, you might be upset you lost it, but you can\u0026rsquo;t, so you don\u0026rsquo;t. Choose a scroll from your inventory. That spell is able to be cast without needing to equip a scroll. Each time you purchase this tattoo it must be for a different spell. The referee should expand this list as a campaign goes on to reflect the experiences of the characters. This way the characters wear their own stories and experiences on their skin. These additional tattoos should be permanent abilities, such as gaining an ability from a certain item. Tattoos which improve numeric superiority should not be added.\nEquipment and Jink # The monetary currency of the planes is jink. Values listed in the equipment tables is their sale value. Trading in unwanted equipment typically nets half the sale value.\nStarting Equipment # Pick one of these when first creating a character. They are not otherwise for sale as a unit.\nArmor # Armor type AC Inventory slots Sale Value (jink) Plain clothes 0 0 - Light 1 1 10 Heavy 2 2 50 Weapons # Weapon type STR Damage Inventory slots Ability (STR cost) Sale Value (jink) Unarmed 1 0 - Light 3 1 Sneak Attack: +3 damage (2) 2 Medium 4 1 Critical: Ignore HP, damage STR directly (3) 8 Heavy 5 2 Cleave: Target all enemies within reach (4) 21 Ranged 3 2 Cover: Attacks against the party must pass a DEX save or miss (2) 13 Tools # Tool Inventory Slots Ability (DEX cost) Sale Value (jink) Shield 1 Parry: +1 AC until next turn (2) 5 Climbing Gear 1 Scale walls and overhangs overwise unclimbable by skilled climbers (3) 5 Thieves\u0026rsquo; tools 1 Open locks and disarm traps that are not crackable by an a skilled lockpicker (2) 8 Cloak of Shadows 1 Hide in dim light in ways a normal person can\u0026rsquo;t (2) 8 Sneaky boots 1 Move more silently than a cat (3) 5 Magical and Ceremonial Gear # Gear Inventory Slots Ability (WIL cost) Sale Value (jink) Scroll 1 Cast Spell: the spell written on it takes effect (3) 50 Holy Symbol 1 Turn Undead: Weak undead are chased away (2) 50 Prayer Beads 1 Lay on Hands: Heal 1 STR, DEX, or WIL damage on touched creature per WIL spent (varies) 30 Miscellaneous Items # Item Inventory Slots Ability Sale Value (jink) Burglar\u0026rsquo;s goggles 1 Evasion: STR damage is first taken from DEX 50 Cloak of the War Mage 1 Mage Armor: STR damage is first taken from WIL 50 War pipes 2 Heavy weapon, deals WIL damage rather than STR, Cleave costs 4 WIL`` 30 Bolas 1 Light weapon, deals DEX damage rather than STR, Sneak attack costs 2 DEX`` Net 1 Medium weapon, deals DEX damage rather than STR, Critical costs 3 DEX`` 1d100 Spell Scrolls # d100 Spell Name Description 01 Glimmerwhisk Summons a shimmering, whisk-like object that gently cleans and polishes small items for 1 minute. 02 Pocket Portal Creates a temporary, tiny portal to a random pocket dimension, useful for hiding small objects. 03 Breeze of Forgetfulness A soft breeze flows through, causing creatures in a small area to momentarily forget what they were doing. 04 Featherweight Arms Makes weapons in an area as light as feathers, reducing their damage but allowing easy handling. 05 Slippery Shoes Makes the target’s shoes incredibly slippery, causing awkward movement but increasing dodge ability. 06 Paper-to-Copper Transmutes ordinary paper into 1 copper coin per sheet.
