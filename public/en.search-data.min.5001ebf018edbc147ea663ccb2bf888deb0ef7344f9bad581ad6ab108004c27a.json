To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 – Scope.\nLicense grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). Other rights.\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\nAttribution.\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a notice that refers to this Public License; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\u0026rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 – Term and Termination.\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 – Interpretation.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\nInability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n5.3.

This * limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or * personal injury resulting from such party\u0026rsquo;s negligence to the * extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

Players' Guide","section":"Thievery! Players' Guide","content":" Player Characters # Game Statistics: Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world. Creating a Character: To create a character, you\u0026rsquo;ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character. Ability Scores: A character\u0026rsquo;s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. Alignment: All beings, whether PCs, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies or spheres of behavior, known as alignments. Languages: The native languages a player character speaks are determined by the character\u0026rsquo;s class. Game Statistics # Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.\nAbility Scores # The fundamental physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of the character. There are six ability scores: Strength (abbreviated STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA). A character is ranked in each ability score by 3–18 (3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best).\nClass # An adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character’s class defines their primary abilities (see Character Classes).\nRace # A character may be human or one of several demihuman species. Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is considered human.\nLevel # Their experience level denotes the character’s experience as an adventurer. Characters typically start play at 1st level (the lowest level of adventurer) and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class.\nExperience Points (XP) # Accumulated experience points track the character’s advancement in the game. The referee awards experience points after a successful adventure. The character\u0026rsquo;s level increases when the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.\nPrime Requisite # The ability score (or scores) most important to the character’s class. The character’s score in these abilities can affect the rate at which the character accumulates experience points.\nAlignment # The character (and every other creature in the game world) is aligned with one of three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos (see Alignment). This alignment determines how certain magic influences the character and should be used by the player as a guideline for role-playing the character.\nHit Points (hp) # The character’s ability to avoid dying. The character has a maximum hit point total and a current hit point total, which are tracked separately. When a character is harmed, their current hit point total is reduced. If this number reaches 0, the character is dead! Rest or healing can restore lost hit points (see Damage, Healing, and Death), but never above the character’s maximum hit point total (this is only increased when the character increases in level).\nHit Dice (HD) # The number of dice used to determine the character’s maximum hit point total. The character’s level determines the number of Hit Dice, and their class determines the type of dice rolled (i.e., d4, d6, d8). Some classes also grant a flat bonus to hit points at certain levels.\nArmor Class (AC) # The character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. AC is determined by the character’s armor and their Dexterity score. Lower Armor Class scores are better, so bonuses decrease the character’s AC, and penalties increase it.\nDual format: The equivalent ascending AC is listed in square brackets for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g., AC 5 [14] — an AC of 5 or 14 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\nUnarmored AC: An unarmored character has AC 9 [10].\nAscending AC (Optional Rule) # Some groups are more familiar with an Armor Class system where higher scores are better. This system is known as Ascending Armor Class (abbreviated AAC) and works as follows:\nArmor Class: When using AAC, higher scores are better. Bonuses to Armor Class increase the AAC score, and penalties decrease it. Attack rolls: When using AAC, the procedure for resolving attack rolls involves using an attack bonus instead of a THAC0 score and attack matrix. Note: Using Ascending Armor Class results in slightly different attack probabilities than using the traditional approach of descending AC with an attack matrix.\nAttack Roll “to Hit AC 0” (THAC0) # Their class and level determine the character’s ability to hit foes in combat. The THAC0 score indicates which row of the attack matrix (see Combat Tables) to use when attacking. Lower THAC0 scores are better.\nDual format: The equivalent attack bonus is listed in square brackets for groups using the optional rule for Ascending AC. (e.g., THAC0 15 [+4] — a THAC0 of 15, or an attack bonus of +4 if using the optional rule for Ascending AC.)\nAttacking: The procedure for making attack rolls is described in Combat.\nSaving Throw Values # The character’s ability to avoid specific dangerous or detrimental effects. There are five saving throw categories: death (or poison), wands, paralysis (or petrification), breath attacks, and spells (or magic rods or staves). The character’s saving throw values are determined by class and level (see Saving Throws).\nMovement Rate # The speed at which the character can move when exploring, traveling, or during combat. Every character has a base movement rate and an encounter movement rate (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one-third of the base movement rate. The default movement rate for characters is 120’ (40’)—a base movement rate of 120’ and an encounter movement rate of 40’.\nOverland: The number of miles a character can travel in a day in the wilderness is determined by dividing their base movement rate by five. Exploration: When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn (10 minutes) Class Abilities # Finally, the character’s class denotes a set of special abilities that the character may use, including the ability to use certain types of armor and weapons and to speak one or more languages.\nCreating a Character # To create a character, you’ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.\nA selection of different character sheet PDFs is available at necroticgnome.com. These may be downloaded and printed for use in your games.\n1. Roll Ability Scores # Roll 3d6 in order of your character’s ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma (see Ability Scores).\nSub-Par Characters # If you roll a character with abysmal ability scores—for example, an 8 or less in every score or a meager rating in more than one ability—the referee may allow you to discard the character and start again.\n2. Choose a Class # Select one of the classes available (see Character Classes), bearing in mind some classes\u0026rsquo; minimum ability score requirements. The chosen class determines your character’s race—unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is human.\n3. Adjust Ability Scores # If you wish, you may raise your character’s prime requisite of your character by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. One point may be added to a prime requisite for every two points by which an ability score is reduced. The following restrictions apply:\nOnly Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way. No score may be lowered below 9. Some character classes may have additional constraints. 4. Note Ability Score Modifiers # Now that your character’s ability scores are fixed, note any associated bonuses or penalties (see Ability Scores).\n5. Note Attack Values # The level progression chart for your character’s class lists your THAC0 score. This indicates your chance of hitting opponents in combat, as determined by the Attack Matrix.\nFor quick reference, it is convenient to look up the values in the attack matrix row corresponding to the character’s THAC0 (determined by class and level) and record them on your character sheet. 1st level characters have a THAC0 of 19 [0], resulting in the attack values below.\nAscending AC (Optional Rule) # If using the optional rule for Ascending AC, record your attack bonus on your character sheet, instead of the attack matrix quick reference.\nAttack Roll 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 AC Hit 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 6. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities # Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of their class, as well as your character’s saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which spells are recorded. The referee may allow you to choose.\n7. Roll Hit Points # Determine your character’s hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see Ability Scores). Your character always starts with at least 1 hit point, regardless of the CON modifier.\nRe-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule) # If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (before applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is to increase the survivability of 1st-level PCs.\n8. Choose Alignment # Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see Alignment), and note this on your character sheet.\n9. Note Known Languages # Your character’s native languages are listed in the class description. This includes the common tongue and the character’s alignment language—see Languages. Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages from the list available in the setting.\n10. Buy Equipment # Your character starts play with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces (see Wealth). You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under Equipment \u0026amp; Services.\nRemember: Your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g., weapons and armor).\n11. Note Armor Class # Two factors determine your character’s Armor Class:\nArmor: The armor worn determines your character’s base AC. See the equipment lists under Armor. Dexterity: A nimble character is more difficult to attack (see Dexterity under Ability Scores). Unarmored AC # If your character has no armor, their base AC is 9 [10].\n12. Note Level and XP # Your character begins play at 1st level with 0 XP.\n13. Name Character # Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!\nAbility Scores # A character’s score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game. The tables below list the modifiers associated with each ability score, with the effects described below.\nStrength (STR) # Brawn, muscle power, and physical might.\nMelee: This is applied to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons. Open doors: The chance of success with attempts to force open a stuck door (see Dungeon Adventuring). STR Melee Open Doors 3 -3 1-in-6 4–5 -2 1-in-6 6–8 -1 1-in-6 9–12 None 2-in-6 13–15 +1 3-in-6 16–17 +2 4-in-6 18 +3 5-in-6 Intelligence (INT) # Learning, memory, and reasoning.\nSpoken languages: Denotes the number of languages the character can speak. Literacy: Indicates the character’s ability to read and write their native languages. INT Spoken Languages Literacy 3 Native (broken speech) Illiterate 4–5 Native Illiterate 6–8 Native Basic 9–12 Native Literate 13–15 Native + 1 additional Literate 16–17 Native + 2 additional Literate 18 Native + 3 additional Literate Wisdom (WIS) # Insight, common sense, and intuition.\nMagic saves: Is applied to saving throws (see Saving Throws) versus magical effects. This does not typically include saves against breath attacks but may apply to any other saving throw category. WIS Magic Saves 3 -3 4–5 -2 6–8 -1 9–12 None 13–15 +1 16–17 +2 18 +3 Dexterity (DEX) # Agility, reflexes, speed, and balance.\nAC: Modifies the character’s AC (a bonus lowers AC, a penalty raises it). Missile: Applied to attack rolls (but not damage rolls) with ranged weapons. Initiative: Modifies the character’s initiative roll if the optional rule for individual initiative is used (see Combat). DEX AC Missile Initiative 3 -3 -3 -2 4–5 -2 -2 -1 6–8 -1 -1 -1 9–12 None None None 13–15 +1 +1 +1 16–17 +2 +2 +1 18 +3 +3 +2 Constitution (CON) # Health, stamina, and endurance.\nHit points: Applies when rolling a character’s hit points (i.e., at 1st level and every time a level is gained thereafter). A character always gains at least 1 hit point per Hit Die, regardless of the CON modifier. CON Hit Points 3 -3 4–5 -2 6–8 -1 9–12 None 13–15 +1 16–17 +2 18 +3 Charisma (CHA) # Leadership potential, personal magnetism, and physical appearance.\nNPC reactions: Applies when hiring retainers and when interacting with monsters. Max # of retainers: Determines the number of retainers a character may have at any time. Retainer loyalty: Determines retainers’ loyalty to the character. Retainers CHA NPC Reactions Max # Loyalty 3 -2 1 4 4–5 -1 2 5 6–8 -1 3 6 9–12 None 4 7 13–15 +1 5 8 16–17 +1 6 9 18 +2 7 10 Prime Requisite # Each character class has one or more prime requisites—ability scores of particular importance to that class’ function. A character’s score in their prime requisites affects how quickly they gain XP.\nXP modifier: Applied to all XP awarded to characters with a single prime requisite. The modifiers for classes with multiple prime requisites are noted in the class description. Prime Requisite XP Modifier 3–5 -20% 6–8 -10% 9–12 None 13–15 +5% 16–18 +10% Alignment # Alignments are cosmic principles that represent broad worldviews. All beings are categorized under three alignments: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos.\nLaw: The belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the universe. Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.\nNeutrality: The belief in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with neither side becoming dominant. Neutral beings will cooperate with others as long as it is not to their detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated and believe in living by their talents rather than relying on others.\nChaos: The belief in evil and the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe, wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. Chaotic beings lie and use others as is suitable to their own ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws, and are driven by whims and the belief in luck.\nRevealing Alignment # The player must inform the referee of their character’s alignment but does not have to tell other players.\nRole-Playing Alignment # Players should consider the chosen alignment when determining their character’s actions. The referee may call the player’s attention to deeds against the chosen alignment and suggest that the character changes to an alignment better fitting their behavior. Deviation from alignment may also be penalized as the referee sees fit.\nLanguages # The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the character’s class. These typically include the common tongue and an alignment language. Characters with high INT may learn additional languages (see Ability Scores).\nThe Common Tongue # The common tongue (sometimes simply called Common) is a language that is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.\nIn some settings, the referee may rule that different cultures in the campaign world have different languages, in which case a particular language must be chosen instead of Common.\nAlignment Languages # All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their alignment. This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognize when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten.\nOther Languages # Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own language, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence (at the referee’s discretion):\nd20 Language 1 Bugbear 2 Doppelgänger 3 Dragon 4 Dwarvish 5 Elvish 6 Gargoyle 7 Gnoll 8 Gnomish 9 Goblin 10 Halfling 11 Harpy 12 Hobgoblin 13 Kobold 14 Lizard man 15 Medusa 16 Minotaur 17 Ogre 18 Orcish 19 Pixie 20 Human dialect Advancement # Experience # All characters who survive an adventure and return to safety gain experience points (XP) due to any treasure recovered or monsters defeated. Experience points are awarded by the referee (see Awarding XP).\nPrime Requisite Modifiers # Characters with especially low or high scores in their class’ prime requisites receive a bonus or penalty for XP earned (see Ability Scores). These modifiers are applied to the total XP gained by each character following an adventure.\nLevel Up # When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player should consult the description of the character’s class and note any improvements in saving throws, attack probabilities, spells per day, and other class abilities. If the character’s Hit Dice increases, a new Hit Die of the specified type should be rolled, adding the result to the character’s maximum hit point total.\nMaximum XP in One Session # Characters can advance up to one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level is lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level.\nLevel Titles # In some campaigns, characters gain the right to bear specific titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of. Level titles often vary significantly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:\nCleric: Acolyte, Adept, Priest(ess), Vicar, Curate, Elder, Bishop, Lama, Matriarch (Patriarch). Dwarf: Dwarven Veteran, Dwarven Warrior, Dwarven Swordmaster, Dwarven Hero, Dwarven Swashbuckler, Dwarven Myrmidon, Dwarven Champion, Dwarven Superhero, Dwarven Lord (Lady). Elf: Medium/Veteran, Seer/Warrior, Conjurer/Swordmaster, Magician/Hero, Enchanter (Enchantress)/Swashbuckler, Warlock (Witch)/Myrmidon, Sorcerer (Sorceress)/Champion, Necromancer/Superhero, Wizard/Lord (Lady). Fighter: Veteran, Warrior, Swordmaster, Hero, Swashbuckler, Myrmidon, Champion, Superhero, Lord (Lady). Halfling: Halfling Veteran, Halfling Warrior, Halfling Swordmaster, Halfling Hero, Halfling Swashbuckler, Halfling Myrmidon, Halfling Champion, Sheriff. Magic-user: Medium, Seer, Conjurer, Magician, Enchanter (Enchantress), Warlock (Witch), Sorcerer (Sorceress), Necromancer, Wizard. Thief: Apprentice, Footpad, Robber, Burglar, Cutpurse, Sharper, Pilferer, Thief, Master Thief. High-Level Play (Optional Rule) # Human character classes are listed as having a maximum level of 14. This range of levels presents the best play experience regarding challenge and reward. However, some groups may wish to continue playing at extremely high levels. This must be considered carefully, as demihuman PCs will be left behind due to their strict level limits. If the referee allows continued play into higher levels, the following guidelines—allowing human characters to advance to a maximum of 36th level—may be used.\nClerics # Clerics require an additional 100,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.\nFighters # Fighters require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Fighters of 20th level may make two attacks per round. This increases to three attacks per round at 25th level and four per round at 30th level.\nMagic-Users # Magic-users require an additional 150,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 1 hit point per level gained. Spells of higher levels become available as the character advances.\nThieves # Thieves require an additional 120,000 XP per level beyond 14th and gain 2 hit points per level gained. Additional skills become available to high-level thieves, including the ability to climb upside down or horizontally, voice skills such as mimicry and ventriloquism, and other skills of deception.\nClass and Level Attack Roll to Hit AC Fighter Cleric, Thief Magic-User -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1–3 1–4 1–5 20 20 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 4–6 5–8 6–10 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7–9 9–12 11–15 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 10–12 13–16 16–20 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 13–15 17–20 21–25 13 13 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 16–18 21–24 26–30 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 19–21 25–28 31–35 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 22–24 29–32 36 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 25–27 33–36 — 5 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 28–30 — — 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 31–33 — — 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 34–36 — — 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Wealth # See Wealth.\nHirelings # See Hirelings.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/thievery/players-guide/classes/","title":"Classes: Thievery!

They may use the following weapons: club, mace, sling, staff, and war hammer.\nDivine Magic # See Spells for full details on divine magic.\nHoly symbol: A cleric must carry a holy symbol (see Adventuring Gear).\nDeity disfavor: Clerics must be faithful to the tenets of their alignment, clergy, and religion. Clerics who fall out of favor with their deity may incur penalties.\nMagical research: A cleric of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to create new spells or other magical effects associated with their deity. When a cleric reaches 9th level, they can also create magic items.\nSpell casting: Once a cleric has proven their faith (from 2nd level), the character may pray to receive spells. The level progression table (below) shows the number of spells a cleric may memorize based on their experience level. The list of spells available to clerics is found in Cleric Spells.\nUsing magic items: As spell casters, clerics can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by divine spell casters (e.g., some magic staves).\nTurning the Undead # Clerics can invoke the power of their deity to repel undead monsters encountered. To turn the undead, the player rolls 2d6. The referee then consults the table below, comparing the roll against the HD of the type of undead monsters targeted.\nSuccessful Turning # If the turning attempt succeeds, the player must roll 2d6 to determine the number of HD affected (turned or destroyed).\nTurned undead: Flee from the cleric’s presence if possible and will not harm the cleric.\nDestroyed undead (result of D): Are instantly and permanently annihilated.\nExcess: Rolled Hit Dice that are insufficient to affect a monster are wasted.\nMinimum effect: At least one undead monster will always be affected on a successful turning.\nMixed groups: If turn undead is used against a mixed group of undead monsters of different types, those with the lowest HD are affected first.\nTurning the Undead # Hit Dice of Monster Type† Level 1 2 2* 3 4 5 6 7-9 1 7 9 11 — — — — — 2 T 7 9 11 — — — — 3 T T 7 9 11 — — — 4 D T T 7 9 11 — — 5 D D T T 7 9 11 — 6 D D D T T 7 9 11 7 D D D D T T 7 9 8 D D D D D T T 7 9 D D D D D D T T 10 D D D D D D D T 11+ D D D D D D D D * 2 HD monsters with a special ability (i.e., with an asterisk next to their HD rating in the monster description).\n† At the referee’s option, the table may be expanded to include more powerful types of undead monsters.\nTurning Table Results # —: The turning fails.\nNumber: The turning attempt succeeds if the 2d6 turning roll is higher or equal to the listed number.\nT: The turning succeeds.\nD: The turning succeeds; the monsters are destroyed, not simply caused to flee.\nAfter Reaching 9th Level # A cleric may construct a stronghold.

Magic-users begin with knowledge of a single spell but gain access to highly potent magic as they advance.\nArcane Magic # See Spells for full details on arcane magic.\nMagical research: A magic-user of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, they can also create magic items.\nSpell casting: Magic-users carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (below) shows the number of spells in the magic-user’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level magic-user has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to magic-users is found in Magic-User Spells.\nUsing magic items: As spell casters, magic-users can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g., magic wands).\nCombat # Magic-users can only use daggers and cannot use shields or wear any armor. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.\nAfter Reaching 11th Level # A magic-user may construct a stronghold (usually in the form of a tower). 1d6 apprentices of levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under the magic-user.\nMagic-User Level Progression # Saving Throws Spells Level XP HD THAC0 D W P B S 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 0 1d4 19 [0] 13 14 13 16 15 1 — — — — — 2 2,500 2d4 19 [0] 13 14 13 16 15 2 — — — — — 3 5,000 3d4 19 [0] 13 14 13 16 15 2 1 — — — — 4 10,000 4d4 19 [0] 13 14 13 16 15 2 2 — — — — 5 20,000 5d4 19 [0] 13 14 13 16 15 2 2 1 — — — 6 40,000 6d4 17 [+2] 11 12 11 14 12 2 2 2 — — — 7 80,000 7d4 17 [+2] 11 12 11 14 12 3 2 2 1 — — 8 150,000 8d4 17 [+2] 11 12 11 14 12 3 3 2 2 — — 9 300,000 9d4 17 [+2] 11 12 11 14 12 3 3 3 2 1 — 10 450,000 9d4+1* 17 [+2] 11 12 11 14 12 3 3 3 3 2 — 11 600,000 9d4+2* 14 [+5] 8 9 8 11 8 4 3 3 3 2 1 12 750,000 9d4+3* 14 [+5] 8 9 8 11 8 4 4 3 3 3 2 13 900,000 9d4+4* 14 [+5] 8 9 8 11 8 4 4 4 3 3 3 14 1,050,000 9d4+5* 14 [+5] 8 9 8 11 8 4 4 4 4 3 3 * Modifiers from CON no longer apply.\nD: Death / poison; W: Wands; P: Paralysis / petrify; B: Breath attacks; S: Spells / rods / staves.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/thievery/players-guide/equipment-and-services/","title":"Equipment \u0026 Services","section":"Thievery!

They are denizens of the planes just like everyone else. What separates them from the rest is their choices. Even mighty heores can fall to a single stroke of a weapon. Mortals are mortal. They are fragile. Even the mighty Achilles or Ajax is slain with a single arrow or spear stroke. The trick is to avoid getting hit, or even better avoid letting anyone want to hit you in the first place. Roleplay is not about combat, narrative, numbers, nor personality, but about choices. The important things that happen are the ways the player characters affect the world around them. Character growth is not a growth in numbers. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect STR or HP to alter dramatically. Expect a growth in what you are capable of. Ideas and extraordinary abliities are represented as items. Among the planes, the abstract tends to be represented as the physical. Your character\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; is the items that give them abilities. Your level up abilities are tattoos you collect. Even your XP is represented as chips, to be traded and spent. The referee is there to challege the characters\u0026rsquo; viewpoints as much as their safety. This is more about perspective and philosophy than it is about killing monsters. The strange creatures are to be feared for their ideas more than fang and claw. Rules are for skipping ahead in time. We don\u0026rsquo;t include rules for the important parts of the game: choices, ethics, planar travel. That\u0026rsquo;s because we want you to take your time on those areas and explore them fully through roleplay and a dialogue between each other and the referee. We include rules for parts we want to get over quickly: combat, skill checks, powers, even making characters and leveling up. We made them simple and quick so they can make room for the important parts. Similarly, saves made out of combat are for skipping past unimportant bits. Character Creation # Roll 3d6. This is your max STR score. Roll 3d6. This is your max DEX score. Roll 3d6. This is your max WIL score. Record your STR, DEX and WIL edge as 0. Roll 1d6. This is your max HP. Add 3 days' rations to your inventory. This takes only one equipment slot. Pick a starting equipment set. Add these to your inventory. Record your worn items and your weapon damage. Record your AC based on your worn armor. Roll 3d6. This is your starting jink. Write a sentence or two about your character\u0026rsquo;s profession before heading out to adventure the planes. Pick a name. Rules # Basic interaction Describe your actions to the referee. They will decide if you succeed or fail. They may ask you to roll a save to determine success. Ability scores You have three ability scores. They act as hit points. They start as the same value as your max ability scores, and may not exceed the max. Applying effort, using special equipment, or taking damage while critically injured can result in lowering your ability scores. If your WIL score reaches 0, you are stupefied until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain 1 fatigue. If your DEX score reaches 0, you are immobilized until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain 1 fatigue. If your STR score reaches 0, you are dead. Forever. Saves To avoid a negative effect, roll 1d20. If the number is less than or equal to your relevant ability, you succeed. Advantage/Disadvantage If an action is particularly easy, the referee may request a roll be made with advantage, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the more favorable roll. Conversely, if an action is particularly difficult, the referee may request a roll be made with disadvantage, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the less favorable roll. Effort A player may turn a roll with disadvantage into a normal roll, or turn a normal roll into a roll with advantage, by applying effort. Applying effort gives the ability score for that roll 3 damage after the effect of the roll is applied. A player can only apply effort once per roll. Edge Activating ability in equipment or applying effort will lower ability scores by a fixed cost. Having an edge decreases the cost by the amount of edge for that ability score. For example, if an ability costs 3 STR, and your STR edge is 1, you lose 2 STR to use that ability. The minimum cost is 0. Profession If the referee determines that the character\u0026rsquo;s profession would result in them being more skilled than usual at that task, the player may assume a minimum edge of 1 for effort applied to that action. AC and HP Any damage received is first reduced by your AC score. If AC cannot reduce it to 0, then the remainder is taken from your HP. Once HP is 0, the remaining damage dealt is taken from the relevant ability score. Physical damage reduces STR, while other effects like magic or poisons may affect DEX or WIL instead. Critical Damage The moment your HP reaches 0 as a result of taking damage, roll a STR save. On a failure, you gain 1 fatigue, you are disabled and can only moan for help and try to crawl to safety. Equipment Slots You have 10 equipment slots to start, 4 of which are considered to be worn or carried. Each piece of equipment you take with you (except coins) takes up equipment slots. Most equipment takes up 1 slot. Small items can be grouped into a single slot. Bulky items use 2 slots. If you have no unused equipment slots, you cannot carry any more equipment and are considered deprived. Carrying a person is considered bulky. Equipment abilities can only be activated while wearing or carrying them. Fatigue You may gain fatigue from various sources such as extreme heat or cold, multiple days without sleep, critical damage, or being downed from ability score damage. Each point of fatigue gained renders a single inventory slot unusable. If this leaves you with no usable inventory slots, you are fatigued. If you have more items equipped than you have usable slots, you must drop the remaining equipment. A full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink removes 1 fatigue. Deprivation Extreme environments, magical effects, and having all usable equipment slots filled causes you to be deprived. While deprived, you cannot restore HP, STR, DEX, nor WIL by resting. Healing Resting allows damage to be recovered to the max score. HP can be restored with a few minutes of rest. STR, DEX, and WIL need a full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink to be restored. Temporary injuries can only have their effects removed with a week of bedrest and a skilled healer. Combat # When combat starts, the game gets a little more structured. Combat happens in the following sequence:\nRoll initiative Everyone makes a DEX save. Surprise Turn Everyone who passed the save takes their turn. Morale Referee rolls to see if the characters under their control flee. Enemy Turn Characters under referee control take their turn. Party Turn Everyone who failed the save takes their turn. End of Round If combat is still ongoing, go to step 1. On a turn # Each character on their turn gets to move and perform an action.\nActions include, but are not limited to:\nAttack If the enemy is within range of the weapon, the attack succeeds. Roll the damage indicated by the weapon. Unarmed Attack If the enemy is within reach, the attack succeeds. The enemy takes 1 damage. Use Equipment They may use the equipment at a tool, or an improvsied weapon, or may activate an ability the equipment gives them. They do so by wearing or holding the equipment as appropriate. Merely carrying it (such as in a backpack) is not sufficient. Interact They may push a button, open a door, roll a barrel, or interact with any other reachable object in their environment. Improvise They may try to do anything else that the character can think of that\u0026rsquo;s capable of being done in a few seconds. The referee determines the outcome. Morale # Each round the referee makes a determination on whether the creatures flee and end the combat. This can be done \u0026ldquo;by feel\u0026rdquo;, or by doing the following procedure.\nRoll a WIL save on behalf of the creatures. One save for the entire group. If they are especially cowardly creatures, or have lost half their group, the roll with disadvantage. If they have an experienced leader, they roll with advantage. If they fail, they attempt to flee and combat is ended. Character Advancement # Experience # XP is gained for attaining goals, discovering new places, and making critical decisions. XP is represented as poker chips. 1 XP is given to each player in a group when the group as a whole is being rewarded. If a single player is being rewarded, the referee gives 2 XP to the player: 1 XP the player keeps for themself, 1 XP is given to another player while stating a reason they deserve it. XP can be traded freely among players. XP can also be spent to \u0026ldquo;grease the wheels\u0026rdquo; of roleplaying, obtaining some minor goal without having to roleplay it or risk failure. Doing so costs the party 4XP.\nXP can be spent to reverse the effects of a bad roll. The player may choose to surrender 1 XP to the referee after failing the save, and avoids whatever the most recent roll\u0026rsquo;s bad effect as if it never happened.\nXP can also be spent to make the character stronger by purchasing tattoos. A player can spend 4 XP to gain any one of the following tattoos. A player may not take a particular tattoo if it was one of their 3 most recently purchased tattoos. That means at most the same tattoo can only be gained for every 4 tattoo purchases.\nTattoos # Mark of Vitality: This tattoo causes you to grow grotesquely muscly. You can perform great feats of strength more often, but maybe you should refrain from delicate tasks like petting kittens. Increase your STR edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Agility: This tattoo causes you to be quicker and more twitchy. Your reflexes are enchanced. Never mind the occasional spasms. That\u0026rsquo;s just your nervous system going into overdrive. Increase your DEX edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Intellect: With this mark your neural pathways have opened and you can see the connections you couldn\u0026rsquo;t before. Also, does anyone else see all the eyes everywhere? Increase your WIL edge by 1, not to exceed 2. Mark of Health: You can dodge so well with this mark that time seems to move a bit slower for you. You\u0026rsquo;re not sure why everyone keeps complaining about you talking so fast. Increase max HP by 2. Mark of Burden: Life is a tetris game. You can see the optimal packing for your stuff. And how to optimally pack everything else, all the time. Increase your number of inventory slots by 1, not to exceed 14. Mark of Skill: Multitasking is what it\u0026rsquo;s all about. You can hold so many things at once. Juggling seems trivial now. You know because you never stop doing it. Increase the number of inventory slots which can be worn or carried by 1, not to exceed 6. Mark of Toughness: Your favorite set of armor is so broken in and perfectly molded to your form that it feels like another layer of skin. That\u0026rsquo;s why it feels like you\u0026rsquo;re ripping your skin off whenever you remove it. Choose one armor type. Increase the AC of that armor type by 1 when you wear it. You may only select this tattoo once. Mark of Arcana: You just got your favorite scroll tattooed right on your skin so now it lives rent-free in your brain, pushing out some core memories that lived there. If you could remember what it was, you might be upset you lost it, but you can\u0026rsquo;t, so you don\u0026rsquo;t. Choose a scroll from your inventory. That spell is able to be cast without needing to equip a scroll. Each time you purchase this tattoo it must be for a different spell. The referee should expand this list as a campaign goes on to reflect the experiences of the characters. This way the characters wear their own stories and experiences on their skin. These additional tattoos should be permanent abilities, such as gaining an ability from a certain item. Tattoos which improve numeric superiority should not be added.\nEquipment and Jink # The monetary currency of the planes is jink. Values listed in the equipment tables is their sale value.
