# Monsters

Monsters are any Non-Player Characters (NPCs) involved in combat. Monsters are not as mechanically fleshed out as Player Characters (PCs): they don't have classes, don't gain levels. They have two main traits: their hit dice (HD), and any special attacks they may have. Hit dice determine their power level, with 1HD being roughly equivalent to (or maybe slightly under-powered from) a 1st level character. 

Use the following table to see roughly the power level of monsters. Creatures with `+n` listed next to their hit doce are monsters with boosted HP, designed to be more resource draining and possibly act more standalone, so they are tougher than creatures with the same HD.

Numbers in parens for the number of attacks and specials are applied to the creatures with `+n` HD, in the columns where the stats are for both types of creature.

The `S/D/C/I/W/C` column lists the Abilty bonuses, if any exist. Unlisted inplies +0.
