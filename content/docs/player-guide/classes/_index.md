## Cleric

The cleric is a holy servant, on a mission. Clerics cast divine magic, largely dealing with healing, protection, and channeling holy light to cast out the legions of the dead. Whether acting as an agent of a religious order, or travelling in search of enlightenment or penance, or simply filling a percieved need, clerics strive to boost others and to drive off the effects of evil magics wherever they go.

## Jack

We all know that person who can take apart machinery and put it back together, plays multiple musical instruments, binds their own books by hand, and practives multiple martial arts. That person would be a jack.

Jacks are, as their name suggest, jacks of all trades. They are competent fighters, being proficient in many weapons and can wear some armor, they have the skills of a thief, and the spells of a mage. They can do none of these these as well as the specialists can, but Jacks are versatile enough to blend into any party and fill the gaps of any role needed.

## Mage

Whether learned through dedicated study, or granted by a supernatural entity, or just naturally gifted, a mage is a person who can wield arcane energy. They gather spells in a book, and can use them to cast rituals, or can memorize the spells to cast them in the heat of battle. The variety of spells they can cast is only limited by the extent of arcane knowledge and the size of the book they are willing to lug around.

#### Trait: Ritual Casting

A mage can cast any spell from their spellbook without memorizing it or expending a spell slot by casting it as a ritual. Doing so makes the spell take a minimum of 10 minutes to cast.

#### Trait: Scroll Use

A mage can cast an arcane spell from a scroll without memorizing the spell or expending a spell slot. Doing so destroys the scroll. The mage must make an intelligence check with proficiency against a DC 10 + spell tier. Failing causes the casting to fail. If the spell is of the level the mage can memorize and cast normally, the check automatically succeeds.

:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------
 Hit dice                 | 1d10
 Starting Hit Points      | 4 + 1d10 + Con Bonus

#### Trait: Combat Maneuvers

A warrior starts having learned two different combat
manuevers. For every three levels gained, you may
select one more combat maneuver to learn. Each maneuver
may only be learned once, except for Extra Attack,
which may be learned multiple times. Each maneuver may
only be activated once per turn. For example, you may
not use Charge on multiple attacks in a round.

#### Trait: Weapon Mastery

For every four levels gained, you may select one of the following categories of weapon: Swords, spears, clubs, staves, daggers, or bows. Attacks with that weapon do an extra die of damage. For each additional mastery gained, you may select to either gain mastery in a new category of weapon, or to stack the effect on an already mastered category for yet another die of damage.

##### Table 26: Combat Maneuvers

 Maneuver           | Description
:-------------------|:------------
 Charge             | Once per Attack action, if you used your full movement to approach an enemy, your next attack roll has advantage.
 Set                | When an enemy uses full movement to attack, you may use a rection to strike first with advantage before the enemy attack.
 Extra Attack       | Using your action to attack involves an extra attack roll. This may be taken more than once, with each time giving an additional attack roll.
 Smash              | Once per attack action, you may elect for your next attack roll to have disadvantage, and you may apply your strength score (note: not strength bonus, the *strength score*) to the damage roll in addition to any normal strength and magic bonuses.
 Parry              | You may forgo one attack roll on your turn to automatically cause the next enemy attack roll targeting you to miss. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. If you have extra attacks, you may forgo additional attack rolls to cause more enemy attack rolls to miss.
 Disarm              | Once per attack action, you may elect for your next attack roll against a weapon-weilding opponent to have disadvantage, and  on a successful hit, the opponent takes no damage from the attack, but instead drops their weapon.
 Two weapon fighting | Once per attack action, if holding a light weapon in your off-hand, you may make an additional attack roll with that weapon at disadvantage. You off-hand is the hand not holding the weapon used for the regular attack rolls.
