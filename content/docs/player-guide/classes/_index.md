## Cleric

The cleric is a holy servant, on a mission. Clerics cast divine magic, largely dealing with healing, protection, and channeling holy light to cast out the legions of the dead. Whether acting as an agent of a religious order, or travelling in search of enlightenment or penance, or simply filling a percieved need, clerics strive to boost others and to drive off the effects of evil magics wherever they go.

### Cleric Traits

##### Table 13: Cleric Traits

:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------

 Starting Hit Points      | 4 + 1d8 + Con Bonus
 Armor & Weapons          | Clubs, maces, and all armor and shields
 Saving Throw Proficiency | Wisdom, Charisma
 Turn Undead              | Turn away undead within 30'
 Augury                   | Ask about the future, get the answer "weal" and/or "woe".
 Divine Casting           | Memorize 1 spell per slot
 Scroll Use               | Can cast scrolls from their spell list
 Smite                    | +1d8 to damage on attack action
 Destroy Undead           | Low-HD undead destroyed on turn

#### Trait: Turn Undead

As an action, a cleric may rebuke any undead creatures in a 30' radius. Any affected undead creatures must make a wisdom save or the must flee and cannot move closer to the cleric. The DC for the save is 10 + the cleric's charisma bonus. The DC increases by 1 upon gaining 3rd level, and again on levels 5, 7, 10, and 13.

#### Trait: Augury

Once per day, a cleric may ask their patron deity a single question about what the future portends. For example, "Is it a good idea to open this door?". The cleric will get one of three answers: "Weal" if the outcome would be generally good, "Woe" if the outcome would be generally bad, or both "Weal and Woe" if the outcome is both good and bad.

#### Trait: Divine Spellcasting

Beginning at 2nd level, a cleric can cast divine spells. Each day the cleric can memorize a number of spells equal to the number of spell slots for that level, from the entire divine spell list.

#### Trait: Scroll Use

A cleric can cast a divine spell from a scroll without memorizing the spell or expending a spell slot. Doing so destroys the scroll. The mage must make an wisdom check with proficiency against a DC 5 + spell level. Failing causes the casting to fail. If the spell is of the level the cleric can memorize and cast normally, the check automatically succeeds.

#### Trait: Smite

Beginning at 4th level, a cleric can channel divine power into a single attack roll per turn, granting 1d8 additional damage on a hit. An extra 1d8 of damage is gained at 8th and 12th level.

## Dwarf

Dwarven armies have gained their sterling reputation through constant warfare with the
underground threats, along with their own spin on the cleric specialized for warfare: the
warpriest. These are pracitioners of prayer and melee combat, and can provide vital support to
the front lines in ways clerics cannot.

Spells can be memorized from the spellbook. An elf can memorize 1 spell per half their level + their intelligence bonus each day. These spells are cast using the spell slot.

#### Trait: Two Weapon Fighting

Elves start having learned the warrior's Two weapon fighting combat maneuver. Once per attack action, if holding a light weapon in your off-hand, you may make an additional attack roll with that weapon at disadvantage. You off-hand is the hand not holding the weapon used for the regular attack rolls.

#### Trait: Additional Combat Maneuver

Upon reaching 5th level, an elf can gain a warrior's combat maneuver from Table 22. They may select another combat maneuver to learn at 9th and 13th levels.

#### Trait: Weapon Mastery

Upon reaching 6th and 10th level, an elf may select one of the following categories of weapon: Swords, spears, clubs, staves, daggers, or bows. Attacks with that weapon do an extra die of damage. For each additional mastery gained, you may select to either gain mastery in a new category of weapon, or to stack the effect on an already mastered category for yet another die of damage.

## Jack

We all know that person who can take apart machinery and put it back together, plays multiple musical instruments, binds their own books by hand, and practives multiple martial arts. That person would be a jack.

Jacks are, as their name suggest, jacks of all trades. They are competent fighters, being proficient in many weapons and can wear some armor, they have the skills of a thief, and the spells of a mage. They can do none of these these as well as the specialists can, but Jacks are versatile enough to blend into any party and fill the gaps of any role needed.

### Jack Traits

##### Table 19: Jack Traits

#### Trait: Jack Skills
Regardless of background, all jacks are proficient in activities involving stealth, lockpick tools, perception, climbing, disarming traps, and sleight of hand, and rolling for initiative.

#### Trait: Lucky
When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an ability check, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Trait: Spellbook

Starting at 2nd level jacks gain a spellbook. That spellbook has 2 spells in it. A jack can learn an effectively infinite number of spells by adding them to the book. Spells can be added by finding other spellbooks and scrolls and adding the spells contained in them to their own spellbook. Doing so from a scroll destroys the scroll.

Spells can be memorized from the spellbook. A jack can memorize 1 spell per level + their intelligence bonus each day. These spells are cast using the spell slot.

#### Trait: Scroll Use

A Jack can cast a spell from a scroll without memorizing the spell or expending a spell slot. Doing so destroys the scroll. The jack must make a charisma check with proficiency against a DC 5 + spell level. Failing causes the casting to fail. If the spell is of the level the jack can memorize and cast normally, the check automatically succeeds. Use the Mage or Cleric spell list to determine spell level.

#### Trait: Deciphering Languages
At 6th level a jack gains proficiency in deciphering languages.

#### Trait: Aid
At 3rd level, a jack grant advantage to an ally within 30' once per day as a reaction. They can grant aid an additional time per day at 7th level, and again at 11th level.

## Mage

Whether learned through dedicated study, or granted by a supernatural entity, or just naturally gifted, a mage is a person who can wield arcane energy. They gather spells in a book, and can use them to cast rituals, or can memorize the spells to cast them in the heat of battle. The variety of spells they can cast is only limited by the extent of arcane knowledge and the size of the book they are willing to lug around.

### Mage Traits

##### Table 21: Mage Traits

Trait                    | Effect
:------------------------|:--------------------------------------
Hit dice                 | 1d4
Starting Hit Points      | 4 + 1d4 + Con Bonus
Armor & Weapons          | Daggers and staves
Saving Throw Proficiency | Intelligence, Wisdom
Spellbook                | 2 spells known, + 1 per level gained
Ritual Casting           | Cast spells from spellbook for free, but it takes 10 minutes
Scroll Use               | Can cast or copy scrolls from their spell list
Cantrip                  | Create minor magical effects at will

#### Trait: Spellbook

Mages start with a spellbook. That spellbook has 2 spells in it. A mage can learn an effectively infinite number of spells by adding them to the book. Spells can be added by finding other spellbooks and scrolls and adding the spells contained in them to their own spellbook. Doing so from a scroll destroys the scroll.

Spells can be memorized from the spellbook. A mage can memorize 1 spell per level + their intelligence bonus each day. These spells are cast using the spell slot.


#### Trait: Ritual Casting

A mage can cast any spell from their spellbook without memorizing it or expending a spell slot by casting it as a ritual. Doing so makes the spell take a minimum of 10 minutes to cast.

#### Trait: Scroll Use

A mage can cast an arcane spell from a scroll without memorizing the spell or expending a spell slot. Doing so destroys the scroll. The mage must make an intelligence check with proficiency against a DC 5 + spell level. Failing causes the casting to fail. If the spell is of the level the mage can memorize and cast normally, the check automatically succeeds.

#### Trait: Cantrip

As an action, the mage may make a single minor magical effect. Example ideas include producing bright sparks, lighting a torch, amplifying your voice similar to a megaphone, or making something give a minor (non-damaging) shock when it is touched.

#### Trait: Backstab
When a thief either attacks on an initiative round, or attacks with advantage, they add 2d6 to their damage roll. The damage increases by an additional 1d6 for every third level gained.

#### Trait: Thief Skills
Regardless of background, all thieves are proficient in activities involving stealth, lockpick tools, perception, climbing, disarming traps, and sleight of hand, and rolling for initiative.

#### Trait: Skill Mastery
For each four levels gained, you may select one thief skill to gain expertise in. The proficiency bonus is applied twice to ability rolls for that activity. You may only select a particular skill for expertise once: expertise cannot apply to the same skill multiple times.

#### Trait: Deciphering Languages
At 6th level a thief gains proficiency in deciphering languages and may gain skill mastery in it at later levels.

#### Trait: Scroll Use
At 8th Level a Thief can attempt to cast scrolls of spells as an action. To do so requires a Charisma check DC 5 + spell of the spell. At 10th level they are proficient in scroll use and so may apply their proficiency bonus to the check. Use the Mage or Cleric spell list to determine spell level.

Trait                    | Effect
:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------

 Saving Throw Proficiency | Strength, Deterity
 Combat Maneuver          | 2 at 1st level, +1 every 3rd level gained
 Weapon Mastery           | Extra die of weapon damage

#### Trait: Combat Maneuvers

A warrior starts having learned two different combat
manuevers. For every three levels gained, you may
select one more combat maneuver to learn. Each maneuver
may only be learned once, except for Extra Attack,
which may be learned multiple times. Each maneuver may
only be activated once per turn. For example, you may
not use Charge on multiple attacks in a round.

#### Trait: Weapon Mastery

For every four levels gained, you may select one of the following categories of weapon: Swords, spears, clubs, staves, daggers, or bows. Attacks with that weapon do an extra die of damage. For each additional mastery gained, you may select to either gain mastery in a new category of weapon, or to stack the effect on an already mastered category for yet another die of damage.

##### Table 26: Combat Maneuvers

 Maneuver           | Description
:-------------------|:------------
 Charge             | Once per Attack action, if you used your full movement to approach an enemy, your next attack roll has advantage.
 Set                | When an enemy uses full movement to attack, you may use a rection to strike first with advantage before the enemy attack.
 Extra Attack       | Using your action to attack involves an extra attack roll. This may be taken more than once, with each time giving an additional attack roll.
 Smash              | Once per attack action, you may elect for your next attack roll to have disadvantage, and you may apply your strength score (note: not strength bonus, the *strength score*) to the damage roll in addition to any normal strength and magic bonuses.
 Parry              | You may forgo one attack roll on your turn to automatically cause the next enemy attack roll targeting you to miss. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. If you have extra attacks, you may forgo additional attack rolls to cause more enemy attack rolls to miss.
 Disarm              | Once per attack action, you may elect for your next attack roll against a weapon-weilding opponent to have disadvantage, and  on a successful hit, the opponent takes no damage from the attack, but instead drops their weapon.
 Two weapon fighting | Once per attack action, if holding a light weapon in your off-hand, you may make an additional attack roll with that weapon at disadvantage. You off-hand is the hand not holding the weapon used for the regular attack rolls.
