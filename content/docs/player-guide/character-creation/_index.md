# Character Creation

Creating a character should be quick and easy. As a result
there is not a large catalague of skills and subclasses
and subraces to choose from. Those more specific
archetypes and be achieved by reskinning existing classes
and backgrounds.

## Roll Ability Scores

### Rolling Method

#### 3d6 Shared Array

Roll 3d6 six times to generate six numbers. Everyone at
the table takes the same six numbers and each allocates
the numbers to different abilities any way they choose.

This method insures that even if there are some very high
or very low scores rolled, it won't be too debilitating to
a single player as every character will have a similarly
low or high ability.

### Abilty Descriptions
Abilities are the scores used to determine how well a
character can naturally do different tasks.

##### Table 5: Abilities

 Abilty       | Used for
:-------------|:--------------------------------
 Strength     | Melee attacks, feats of might
 Dexterity    | Ranged attacks, agile maneuvers
 Constitution | Bonus HP, Endurance, death save
 Intelligence | Arcane magic, knowledge
 Wisdom       | Divine magic, awareness
 Charisma     | Followers, persuasion

### Ability Bonuses
Abilities determine bonuses to roll ability checks.

##### Table 6: Ability Bonuses

 Score  | Bonus
:-------|:-------
 3-6    | -2
 6-7    | -1
 8-13   | +0
 14-15  | +1
 16-17  | +2
 18-20  | +3

## Choose Background
Backgrounds determine the skills and tool proficiencies
and choose two abilities to increase by 1 to indicate
prior training.

##### Table 7: Example Backgrounds

 Background | +1 to    | Potential Skills
:-----------|:---------|:----------------------------
 Noble      | Int, Cha | Diplomacy, deception
 Soldier    | Str, Con | Athletics, survival
 Acolyte    | Wis, Cha | Religion, medicine
 Scholar    | Int, Wis | Arcana, history
 Hermit     | Con, Wis | Survival, nature
 Pastoral   | Con, Cha | Animal handling,  survival
 Scoundrel  | Dex, Cha | Stealth, sleight of hand
 Enforcer   | Str, Dex | Intimidation, perception
 Performer  | Dex, Cha | Performance, acrobatics
 Trade      | any two  | Dependent on the trade

## Choose Class
Classes determine the character archetype.

##### Table 8: Class List

 Class      | Specialty
:-----------|:---------------------------------
 Cleric     | Divine magic, turn undead
 Dwarf      | Combat, Divine magic
 Elf        | Two weapon fighting, arcane magic
 Jack       | Jack of all trades
 Mage       | Arcane magic, ritual casting
 Thief      | Backstab, skills
 Warrior    | Combat, weapon mastery

## Choose Equipment

Each character starts with one light weapon, One tool
relevant to their background, and 3d6 x 10 gp.

They can buy armor, shields, stronger weapons, and other
sundries and adventuring gear from the equipment list
before starting on their first adventure.

## Choose Spells
Spellcasters select 2 spells for their initial spellbook, if  they have spellcasting ability at first level. Spells are listed in Table 33 for arcane spellcasters and Table 34 for divine spellcasters.

## Calculate Starting Numbers
Now that the main choices have been made, there's just a
few more things which need to be filled out before you're
ready to go.

##### Table 9: Starting Numbers

 Number            | Formula
:------------------|:---------
 Proficiency bonus | +2
 Hit Points        | 4 + Hit die + Con modifier
 AC                | (See armor table)
 AC (if unarmored) | 10 + Dex modifier
 Initiative        | Dex Modifier


And that's it. Happy adventuring!

# Higher levels

As time goes on and your character plies their adventuring
craft and practice the tasks of dungeoneering and combat
and questing, they are bound to eventually get better at
what they do. As they do, they will gain class levels and
grow more powerful as their influence spreads.

### How to Level Up

All that's needed to level up is to adjust a few vital
statistics.

#### Hit Points

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die.
Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the
roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point
maximum.

For example, a Fighter with a Constitution score of 14 (+1
bonus) will see their Hit Points increase by 1d10 + 1 each
level.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 for every four levels
gained. So it starts as +2, increases to +3 upon reaching
level 5, increases to +4 upon reaching level 9, +5 at level
13 and so on.

#### Spell Slots

The spell slots for a spellcaster are updated according to
the chart in their class description.

Spellcasters add 2  spells to their spellbook of a level for
which they have spell slots. They may not add any spells
not in their respective spell list. If they do not yet any
any slots upon leveling, they do not add any spells to
their book.

A spellcaster may also add any spells from another
spellbook or scroll to their own book as they find them,
provided the spells are in the spell list for the class.

### When to Gain Levels

This one is left entirely to the GM. There are as many
opinions on how to determine this as there are GMs. The
only rule imposed here, however is to *reward the kind of
behavior the GM wants to promote*. Here are a few ways
leveling can be used as a reward to promote a particular
play style.

Something to consider is changing the leveling method mid-
campaign. This can be a very effective tool for keeping the
campaing exciting as characters grow out of different play
styles. A good point to change up progression is when the
tier of play shifts.

For example, maybe low levels are about getting loot from
dungeons, so using gold for experience is appropriate.
Later when the PCs gain a stronghold, they may level as
certain objectives are achieved. At that point, they
determine the direction of their domain and are dealing
with the consequences of their decisions, so the GM may set
objectives based on what the players' long term goals
should be, and level the PCs as reward for chasing those
objectives.

##### Table 10: Leveling Methods

 Method                               | Style Encouraged
:-------------------------------------|:----------------------
 1 XP per gold piece                  | Dungeon looting
 XP per monster slain                 | Combat-focused
 Milestones reached                   | Story-focused
 Areas discovered                     | Exploration-focused
 Office vacancy/combat for leadership | Social power structures
 Player-set objectives                | Self-determination
 XP per session                       | Attendance prioritized

### Tiers of Play

As characters gain in power, they seek challenges of
greater power while their presence invites greater
conflict. In other words, the world should react to the
change of the balance in power that higher-level PCs will
bring. Doing so changes the focus of play to something
greater in scope. These changing foci are called *tiers of
play*. When the tier changes is determined by the GM in
response to player actions.

#### Tier 1: Local Threats

PCs tend to start out exploring a local area, fighting
monsters that pose local threats. The blacksmith's daughter
is missing. There's a nearby cult. Here the rewards tend to
be gaining combat power and wealth.

#### Tier 2: Regional Politics

At some point the PCs tend to have amassed enough power
that they find themselves, willingly or not, more
responsible for the local area against larger regional
threats. At this point it's usually not a single monster as
much as it is organizations.

Ususally it is appropriate for the PCs to gain a stronghold
and start to attract followers.

#### Tier 3: Kingdoms and Warfare

At this tier, the adventurers cannot be easily challenged
by any single person or monster, but are dealing with some of
the campaign setting's central tensions which prop up the
world's power structures. The threats at this stage
are to entire countries or even the world, and can involve
leading armies in massive struggles.

#### Tier 4: Transcendence

This tier is when the focus of the players is on their
legacy. They will meet with the proxies and avatars of
deities directly. PCs will seek immortality either
figuratively or literally, possibly seeking godhood.

The challenges in this tier have to do with the great
cosmic conflicts and interplanar creatures.

# Backgrounds
Characters weren't born as adventurers. They grew up in an
area, in a certain niche of a certain society. They
learned the in's and out's of the business of those around
them. They learned the trades of the adults around them.
They exercised their bodies and minds to perform certain
tasks. They got proficient in certain types of work. They
developed different outlooks.

Backgrounds are meant as an abstraction to cover all of
the experience of growing up, all the way up to picking up
your adventuring gear. Where you come from and how you
were raised gives each character advantages in different
situations, and nobody ends up perfectly well-rounded.

Each character picks or develops their own background on
character creation. It should be something clear enough
that the one-word name of the background should give
people a good idea of what kind of activities your
character my might expected to excel at.

### Where's the Skills?

Individual skills are not included in this game, to be
replaced by a general sense of what people with your
background might do often. When an ability check happens,
the GM can indicate whether your background may allow you
to add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

While the GM is expected to maintain a list of each
character's backgrounds, feel free to ask (not argue!) if
this is a task which resembles something you have
experience with. For example, someone raised as a farrier
(one who makes and fits horseshoes) would reasonably be
expected to be proficient in both smithing and animal
handling, along with knowledge tangential to both fields,
while a carpenter would be procifient in woodworking,
nature where it concerns the forest and trees, some
structural engineering learned when making houses, some
knowledge of the law concerning housing, residency,
building codes, and so on.

This way of handling proficiency has several advantages:
1. When it comes to decide which character should perform
a task, volunteering because you "worked with animals all
the time growing up" is less immersion-breaking than doing
it because you "have a +5 to animal handling".
1. The list of skills is flexible to fit any genre. Maybe
a world had sci-fi or modern elements: instead of adding
skills, you can flexibly determine proficiency easily on a
case-by-case basis, without having to add skills relvant
to that society like "hacking". Also, as a GM you don't
have to worry about diluting the skill point value by
making skills too granular.
1. It saves character sheet space significantly and can
speed up play by not having to look up numbers.
1. Encourages creative play, so you don't feel limited to
only doing actions that are part of a list.
1. You can fit all the things a character can do well
inside a list.

### Making a Background

A list of example backgrounds is included in **Table 3:
Backgrounds**, but you are not limited to just those
options. The sky is the limit, subject to GM discretion,
of course. You just need a few things to make your own
background:

1. A name that is identifiable enough to give another
person a reasonable idea of what skills you might possess
just from that one word.
1. Two ability scores that would be developed by such an
envrionment to reflect the years of physical and mental
conditioning involved in that background.
1. A reason why someone in that profession would adopt the
high-risk, high-reward, "adrenaline junky" lifestyle of an
adventurer.
1. GM buy-in. Make sure the GM understands what's involved
in growing up in this background, and agrees to the
ability bonuses.

# Classes

A character's class is the archetype that they embody. In this game, classes exist to give characters mechanical abilities. In other words, while backgrounds define who they are, classes define what they can do.

##### Table 11: Quick Summary of CLasses

 Class   | Hit Die type | Weapons & Armor                                             | Saves
:--------|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:---------
 Cleric  | d8           | Clubs, maces, and all armor and shields                     | Wis, Cha
 Dwarf   | d8           | All melee weapons, all armor and shields                    | Con, Wis
 Elf     | d6           | Swords, bows, light weapons, light armor                    | Str, Int
 Jack    | d6           | All one-handed weapons, crossbows, light weapons and armors | Dex, Con
 Mage    | d4           | Daggers and staves                                          | Int, Wis
 Thief   | d6           | Crossbows, light weapons and armors                         | Dex, Cha
 Warrior | d10          | Any & all                                                   | Str, Dex

### Hit Dice
Hit dice describe three intertwined concepts.

#### Hit Points
Hit dice describe how many dice you should have rolled to determine your total hit points. So if you have 5d6 and upon level up you now have 6d6, your hit point total increases by 1d6 + your Con bonus (minimum 1).

#### Power level and Spell Resilience
Many spells affects a certain number of hit dice of creatures. Use the hit dice listed in the class table to determine whether or not it affects you.

#### Healing While Resting
When resting for 8 hours, the hit dice indicate how many hit points are gained over the course of rest. For example, if you have 5d6 hit points and you rest, you heal for 5d6 + Con bonus hit points.

### Racial Archetypes

Three of the classes: Dwarf and Elf, are representative of three idiosyncratic martial traditions of these three cultures. Namely, elven bladesingers and dwarven warpriests. Each of these is a blend of other class abilities, along with some unique traits of their own.

Don't read the racial martial archetypes as being strictly limited to those races. The whole point is to be light on the rules, and allow variety through GM discretion and reskinning. So if you want, say, a human bard who can fight and sing and use some magic, take the Elf class, give them a human musical background, and you'll be set.

### Reskinning

Many of the classes in other games are not present here. That's because it's highly encouraged to take one of the seven base classes and to "reskin" the class by changing the flavor text, giving alternate explanations to how and why certain class traits work, and make cosmetic changes to the traits themselves to emulate other character archetypes out there.

Below is a list of suggestions as starting points or even drop-in replacements for some classes you may be looking for:

##### Table 12: Class Equivalents

 Archetype        | Class
:-----------------|:--------
 Arcane Trickster | Jack
 Assassin         | Thief
 Barbarian        | Warrior
 Bard             | Jack
 Battle Master    | Dwarf
 Druid            | Cleric
 Monk / Mystic    | Warrior
 Paladin          | Dwarf
 Psion / Adept    | Mage
 Ranger           | Elf
 Sorcerer         | Mage
 Shaman           | Cleric
 Warlock          | Mage

### Multi-classing

A class is chosen at character creation, and as the character gains levels, the classes may offer new abilities. For simplicity's sake, a character may not change classes, and they may not take on more than one class at a time. However, there are certain classes, namely the various racial martial archetypes, which effectively function as multi-class options, as they borrow abilities from two other classes.
