# Equipment

Equipment is generally available to buy in any outpost of civilization. Depending of where you are buying from, there may be a limit to what is on hand or able to be ordered. Vehicles are typically made to order and require specialized labor to make.

Items listed below can be carried, worn, or equipped as is reasonable: that is, you may have as many swords strapped to you as makes practical sense, a the GM's discretion. 

Some magic items require attunement in order to use their powers. Such magic items are generally ones which have at least a very limited form of will and awareness, if not proper intelligence, and must be willed into doing the wielder's bidding. Attuning just requires the character to dedicate a small amount of time becoming familiar with the items. The number of magic items a character can attune to at one time is limited to 2 + Cha bonus (minimum 1).
