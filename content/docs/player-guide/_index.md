# Character Creation

Creating a character should be quick and easy. As a result 
there is not a large catalague of skills and subclasses 
and subraces to choose from. Those more specific 
archetypes and be achieved by reskinning existing classes 
and backgrounds.

## Roll Ability Scores

### Rolling Method

#### 3d6 Shared Array

Roll 3d6 six times to generate six numbers. Everyone at 
the table takes the same six numbers and each allocates 
the numbers to different abilities any way they choose.

This method insures that even if there are some very high 
or very low scores rolled, it won't be too debilitating to 
a single player as every character will have a similarly 
low or high ability.

### Abilty Descriptions
Abilities are the scores used to determine how well a 
character can naturally do different tasks.

##### Table 5: Abilities

 Abilty       | Used for                        
:------------:|:--------------------------------
 Strength     | Melee attacks, feats of might   
 Dexterity    | Ranged attacks, agile maneuvers 
 Constitution | Bonus HP, Endurance, death save 
 Intelligence | Arcane magic, knowledge         
 Wisdom       | Divine magic, awareness         
 Charisma     | Followers, persuasion           

### Ability Bonuses
Abilities determine bonuses to roll ability checks.

##### Table 6: Ability Bonuses

 Score  | Bonus  
:------:|:------:
 3-6    | -2     
 6-7    | -1     
 8-13   | +0     
 14-15  | +1     
 16-17  | +2     
 18-20  | +3     

## Choose Background
Backgrounds determine the skills and tool proficiencies 
and increase two abilities to increase by 1 to indicate 
prior training.

##### Table 7: Example Backgrounds

 Background | +1 to    | Potential Skills  
:-----------|:---------|:----------------------------
 Noble      | Int, Cha | Diplomacy, deception        
 Soldier    | Str, Con | Athletics, survival         
 Acolyte    | Wis, Cha | Religion, medicine          
 Scholar    | Int, Wis | Arcana, history             
 Hermit     | Con, Wis | Survival, nature            
 Pastoral   | Con, Cha | Animal handling,  survival  
 Scoundrel  | Dex, Cha | Stealth, sleight of hand    
 Enforcer   | Str, Dex | Intimidation, perception    
 Performer  | Dex, Cha | Performance, acrobatics     
 Trade      | any two  | Dependent on the trade      

## Choose Class
Classes determine the character archetype.

##### Table 8: Class List

 Class      | Specialty                        
:-----------|:---------------------------------
 Cleric     | Divine magic, turn undead        
 Dwarf      | Combat, Divine magic             
 Elf        | Two weapon fighting, arcane magic
 Jack       | Jack of all trades               
 Mage       | Arcane magic, ritual casting     
 Thief      | Backstab, skills                 
 Warrior    | Combat, weapon mastery           

## Choose Equipment

Each character starts with one light weapon, One tool 
relevant to their background, and 3d6 x 10 gp.

They can buy armor, shields, stronger weapons, and other 
sundries and adventuring gear from the equipment list 
before starting on their first adventure.

## Choose Spells
Spellcasters select 2 spells for their initial spellbook, if  they have spellcasting ability at first level. Spells are listed in Table 33 for arcane spellcasters and Table 34 for divine spellcasters.

## Calculate Starting Numbers
Now that the main choices have been made, there's just a 
few more things which need to be filled out before you're 
ready to go.

##### Table 9: Starting Numbers

 Number            | Formula                                      
:-----------------:|:---------
 Proficiency bonus | +2 
 Hit Points        | 4 + Hit die + Con modifier  
 AC                | Armor AC *or* 10 + Dex modifier if unarmored 
 Initiative        | Dex Modifier 
 

And that's it. Happy adventuring!

# Higher levels

As time goes on and your character plies their adventuring 
craft and practice the tasks of dungeoneering and combat 
and questing, they are bound to eventually get better at 
what they do. As they do, they will gain class levels and 
grow more powerful as their influence spreads.

### How to Level Up

All that's needed to level up is to adjust a few vital 
statistics.

#### Hit Points

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. 
Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the 
roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point 
maximum.

For example, a Fighter with a Constitution score of 14 (+1 
bonus) will see their Hit Points increase by 1d10 + 1 each 
level.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 for every four levels 
gained. So it starts as +2, increases to +3 upon reaching 
level 5, increases to +4 upon reaching level 9, +5 at level 
13 and so on.

#### Spell Slots

The spell slots for a spellcaster are updated according to 
the chart in their class description.

Spellcasters add 2  spells to their spellbook of a tier for 
which they have  spell slots. They may not add any spells 
not in their respective spell list. If they do not yet any 
any slots upon  leveling, they do not add any spells to 
their book.

A spellcaster may also add any spells from another 
spellbook or scroll to their own book as they find them, 
provided the spells are in the spell list for the class.

### When to Gain Levels

This one is left entirely to the GM. There are as many 
opinions on how to determine this as there are GMs. The 
only rule imposed here, however is to *reward the kind of 
behavior the GM wants to promote*. Here are a few ways 
leveling can be used as a reward to promote a particular 
play style.

Something to consider is changing the leveling method mid-
campaign. This can be a very effective tool for keeping the 
campaing exciting as characters grow out of different play 
styles. A good point to change up progression is when the 
tier of play shifts.

For example, maybe low levels are about getting loot from 
dungeons, so using gold for experience is appropriate. 
Later when the PCs gain a stronghold, they may level as 
certain objectives are achieved. At that point, they 
determine the direction of their domain and are dealing 
with the consequences of their decisions, so the GM may set 
objectives based on what the players' long term goals 
should be, and level the PCs as reward for chasing those 
objectives.

##### Table 10: Leveling Methods

| Method                               | Style Encouraged      |
|:------------------------------------:|:----------------------|
| 1 XP per gold piece                  | Dungeon looting       |
| XP per monster slain                 | Combat-focused        |
| Milestones reached                   | Story-focused         |
| Areas discovered                     | Exploration-focused   |
| Office vacancy/combat for leadership |Social power structures|
| Player-set objectives                | Self-determination    |
| XP per session                       | Attendance prioritized|

### Tiers of Play

As characters gain in power, they seek challenges of 
greater power while their presence invites greater 
conflict. In other words, the world should react to the 
change of the balance in power that higher-level PCs will 
bring. Doing so changes the focus of play to something 
greater in scope. These changing foci are called *tiers of 
play*. When the tier changes is determined by the GM in 
response to player actions.

#### Tier 1: Local Threats

PCs tend to start out exploring a local area, fighting 
monsters that pose local threats. The blacksmith's daughter 
is missing. There's a nearby cult. Here the rewards tend to 
be gaining combat power and wealth.

#### Tier 2: Regional Politics

At some point the PCs tend to have amassed enough power 
that they find themselves, willingly or not, more 
responsible for the local area against larger regional 
threats. At this point it's usually not a single monster as 
much as it is organizations.

Ususally it is appropriate for the PCs to gain a stronghold 
and start to attract followers.

#### Tier 3: Kingdoms and Warfare

At this tier, the adventurers cannot be easily challenged 
by any single person or monster, but are dealing with some of 
the campaign setting's central tensions which prop up the 
world's power structures. The threats at this stage 
are to entire countries or even the world, and can involve 
leading armies in massive struggles.

#### Tier 4: Transcendence

This tier is when the focus of the players is on their 
legacy. They will meet with the proxies and avatars of 
deities directly. PCs will seek immortality either 
figuratively or literally, possibly seeking godhood.

The challenges in this tier have to do with the great 
cosmic conflicts and interplanar creatures.

# Backgrounds
Characters weren't born as adventurers. They grew up in an 
area, in a certain niche of a certain society. They 
learned the in's and out's of the business of those around 
them. They learned the trades of the adults around them. 
They exercised their bodies and minds to perform certain 
tasks. They got proficient in certain types of work. They 
developed different outlooks.

Backgrounds are meant as an abstraction to cover all of 
the experience of growing up, all the way up to picking up 
your adventuring gear. Where you come from and how you 
were raised gives each character advantages in different 
situations, and nobody ends up perfectly well-rounded.

Each character picks or develops their own background on 
character creation. It should be something clear enough 
that the one-word name of the background should give 
people a good idea of what kind of activities your 
character my might expected to excel at.

### Where's the Skills?

Individual skills are not included in this game, to be 
replaced by a general sense of what people with your 
background might do often. When an ability check happens, 
the GM can indicate whether your background may allow you 
to add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

While the GM is expected to maintain a list of each 
character's backgrounds, feel free to ask (not argue!) if 
this is a task which resembles something you have 
experience with. For example, someone raised as a farrier 
(one who makes and fits horseshoes) would reasonably be 
expected to be proficient in both smithing and animal 
handling, along with knowledge tangential to both fields, 
while a carpenter would be procifient in woodworking, 
nature where it concerns the forest and trees, some 
structural engineering learned when making houses, some 
knowledge of the law concerning housing, residency, 
building codes, and so on.

This way of handling proficiency has several advantages:
1. When it comes to decide which character should perform 
a task, volunteering because you "worked with animals all 
the time growing up" is less immersion-breaking than doing 
it because you "have a +5 to animal handling".
1. The list of skills is flexible to fit any genre. Maybe 
a world had sci-fi or modern elements: instead of adding 
skills, you can flexibly determine proficiency easily on a 
case-by-case basis, without having to add skills relvant 
to that society like "hacking". Also, as a GM you don't 
have to worry about diluting the skill point value by 
making skills too granular.
1. It saves character sheet space significantly and can 
speed up play by not having to look up numbers.
1. Encourages creative play, so you don't feel limited to 
only doing actions that are part of a list.
1. You can fit all the things a character can do well 
inside a list.

### Making a Background

A list of example backgrounds is included in **Table 3: 
Backgrounds**, but you are not limited to just those 
options. The sky is the limit, subject to GM discretion, 
of course. You just need a few things to make your own 
background:

1. A name that is identifiable enough to give another 
person a reasonable idea of what skills you might possess 
just from that one word.
1. Two ability scores that would be developed by such an 
envrionment to reflect the years of physical and mental 
conditioning involved in that background.
1. A reason why someone in that profession would adopt the 
high-risk, high-reward, "adrenaline junky" lifestyle of an 
adventurer.
1. GM buy-in. Make sure the GM understands what's involved 
in growing up in this background, and agrees to the 
ability bonuses.

# Classes

A character's class is the archetype that they embody. In this game, classes exist to give characters mechanical abilities. In other words, while backgrounds define who they are, classes define what they can do.

##### Table 11: Quick Summary of CLasses

| Class   | Hit Die type | Weapons & Armor                                             | Saves    |
|:-------:|:------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|
| Cleric  | d8           | Clubs, maces, and all armor and shields                     | Wis, Cha |
| Dwarf   | d8           | All melee weapons, all armor and shields                    | Con, Wis |
| Elf     | d6           | Swords, bows, light weapons, light armor                    | Str, Int |
| Jack    | d6           | All one-handed weapons, crossbows, light weapons and armors | Dex, Con | 
| Mage    | d4           | Daggers and staves                                          | Int, Wis |
| Thief   | d6           | Crossbows, light weapons and armors                         | Dex, Cha |
| Warrior | d10          | Any & all                                                   | Str, Dex |

### Hit Dice
Hit dice describe three intertwined concepts.

#### Hit Points
Hit dice describe how many dice you should have rolled to determine your total hit points. So if you have 5d6 and upon level up you now have 6d6, your hit point total increases by 1d6 + your Con bonus (minimum 1).

#### Power level and Spell Resilience
Many spells affects a certain number of hit dice of creatures. Use the hit dice listed in the class table to determine whether or not it affects you.

#### Healing While Resting
When resting for 8 hours, the hit dice indicate how many hit points are gained over the course of rest. For example, if you have 5d6 hit points and you rest, you heal for 5d6 + Con bonus hit points.

### Racial Archetypes

Three of the classes: Dwarf and Elf, are representative of three idiosyncratic martial traditions of these three cultures. Namely, elven bladesingers and dwarven warpriests. Each of these is a blend of other class abilities, along with some unique traits of their own.

Don't read the racial martial archetypes as being strictly limited to those races. The whole point is to be light on the rules, and allow variety through GM discretion and reskinning. So if you want, say, a human bard who can fight and sing and use some magic, take the Elf class, give them a human musical background, and you'll be set.

### Reskinning

Many of the classes in other games are not present here. That's because it's highly encouraged to take one of the seven base classes and to "reskin" the class by changing the flavor text, giving alternate explanations to how and why certain class traits work, and make cosmetic changes to the traits themselves to emulate other character archetypes out there.

Below is a list of suggestions as starting points or even drop-in replacements for some classes you may be looking for:

##### Table 12: Class Equivalents

| Archetype        | Class   |
|:-----------------|:--------|
| Arcane Trickster | Jack    |
| Assassin         | Thief   |
| Barbarian        | Warrior |
| Bard             | Jack    |
| Battle Master    | Dwarf   |
| Druid            | Cleric  |
| Monk / Mystic    | Warrior |
| Paladin          | Dwarf   |
| Psion / Adept    | Mage    |
| Ranger           | Elf     |
| Sorcerer         | Mage    |
| Shaman           | Cleric  |
| Warlock          | Mage    |

### Multi-classing

A class is chosen at character creation, and as the character gains levels, the classes may offer new things to do. For simplicity's sake, a character may not change levels, but there are certain classes, namely the various racial martial archetypes, which effectively function as multi-class options, as they borrow abilities from two other classes.

## Cleric

The cleric is a holy servant, on a mission. Clerics cast divine magic, largely dealing with healing, protection, and channeling holy light to cast out the legions of the dead. Whether acting as an agent of a religious order, or travelling in search of enlightenment or penance, or simply filling a percieved need, clerics strive to boost others and to drive off the effects of evil magics wherever they go.

### Cleric Traits

##### Table 13: Cleric Traits

|                          |                                          |

| Starting Hit Points      | 4 + 1d8 + Con Bonus                      |
| Armor & Weapons          | Clubs, maces, and all armor and shields  |
| Saving Throw Proficiency | Wisdom, Charisma                         |
| Spell Save DC            | 8 + Proficiency bonus + Wis Bonus        |
| Turn Undead              | Turn away undead within 30'              |
| Divine Casting           | Memorize 1 spell per slot                |
| Scroll Use               | Can cast scrolls from their spell list   |
| Smite                    | +1d8 to damage on attack action          |
| Destroy Undead           | Low-HD undead destroyed on turn          |

#### Trait: Turn Undead

As an action, a cleric may rebuke any undead creatures in a 30' radius. Any affected undead creatures must make a wisdom save or the must flee and cannot move closer to the cleric. The DC for the save is 10 + the cleric's charisma bonus. The DC increases by 1 upon gaining 3rd level, and again on levels 5, 7, 10, and 13.

#### Trait: Divine Spellcasting

Beginning at 2nd level, a cleric can cast divine spells. Each day the cleric can memorize a number of spells equal to the number of spell slots for that tier, from the entire divine spell list.

#### Trait: Scroll Use

A cleric can cast a divine spell from a scroll without memorizing the spell or expending a spell slot. Doing so destroys the scroll. The mage must make an wisdom check with proficiency against a DC 10 + spell tier. Failing causes the casting to fail. If the spell is of the level the cleric can memorize and cast normally, the check automatically succeeds.

#### Trait: Smite

Beginning at 4th level, a cleric can channel divine power into a single attack roll per turn, granting 1d8 additional damage on a hit. An extra 1d8 of damage is gained at 8th and 12th level.

## Dwarf

Dwarven armies have gained their sterling reputation through constant warfare with the 
underground threats, along with their own spin on the cleric specialized for warfare: the 
warpriest. These are pracitioners of prayer and melee combat, and can provide vital support to 
the front lines in ways clerics cannot.

#### Trait: Lay on Hands

Each day, a dwarf has a pool of healing dice equal to their level. As a reaction, they can spend these dice at any time to heal themselves or anyone they can touch within 5'. That character is healed of 1d8 damage per die spent. Any number of dice may be spent per reaction, provided they are still available.

#### Trait: Smite

Beginning at 2nd level, a dwarf can channel divine power into a single attack roll per turn, granting 1d8 additional damage on a hit. An extra 1d8 of damage is gained at 5th, 8th and 11th level.

#### Trait: Divine Spellcasting

## Jack

We all know that person who can take apart machinery and put it back together, plays multiple musical instruments, binds their own books by hand, and practives multiple martial arts. That person would be a jack.

Jacks are, as their name suggest, jacks of all trades. They are competent fighters, being proficient in many weapons and can wear some armor, they have the skills of a thief, and the spells of a mage. They can do none of these these as well as the specialists can, but Jacks are versatile enough to blend into any party and fill the gaps of any role needed.

### Warrior Traits

##### Table 25: Warrior Traits

|                          |                                           |
|:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| Hit dice                 | 1d10                                      |
| Starting Hit Points      | 4 + 1d10 + Con Bonus                      |
| Armor & Weapons          | All armor, weapons, and shields           |
| Saving Throw Proficiency | Strength, Deterity                        |
| Combat Maneuver          | 2 at 1st level, +1 every 3rd level gained |
| Weapon Mastery           | Extra die of weapon damage                |

#### Trait: Combat Maneuvers

A warrior starts having learned two different combat 
manuevers. For every three levels gained, you may 
select one more combat maneuver to learn. Each maneuver 
may only be learned once, except for Extra Attack, 
which may be learned multiple times. Each maneuver may 
only be activated once per turn. For example, you may 
not use Charge on multiple attacks in a round.

#### Trait: Weapon Mastery

For every four levels gained, you may select one of the following categories of weapon: Swords, spears, clubs, staves, daggers, or bows. Attacks with that weapon do an extra die of damage. For each additional mastery gained, you may select to either gain mastery in a new category of weapon, or to stack the effect on an already mastered category for yet another die of damage.

##### Table 26: Combat Maneuvers

| Maneuver           | Description |
|:-------------------|:------------|
| Charge             | Once per Attack action, if you used your full movement to approach an enemy, your next attack roll has advantage. |
| Set                | When an enemy uses full movement to attack, you may use a rection to strike first with advantage before the enemy attack. |
| Extra Attack       | Using your action to attack involves an extra attack roll. This may be taken more than once, with each time giving an additional attack roll. |
| Smash              | Once per attack action, you may elect for your next attack roll to have disadvantage, and you may apply your strength score (note: not strength bonus, the *strength score*) to the damage roll in addition to any normal strength and magic bonuses. |
| Parry              | You may forgo one attack roll on your turn to automatically cause the next enemy attack roll targeting you to miss. The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. If you have extra attacks, you may forgo additional attack rolls to cause more enemy attack rolls to miss.  |
| Disarm              | Once per attack action, you may elect for your next attack roll against a weapon-weilding opponent to have disadvantage, and  on a successful hit, the opponent takes no damage from the attack, but instead drops their weapon.  
| Two weapon fighting | Once per attack action, if holding a light weapon in your off-hand, you may make an additional attack roll with that weapon at disadvantage. You off-hand is the hand not holding the weapon used for the regular attack rolls.
