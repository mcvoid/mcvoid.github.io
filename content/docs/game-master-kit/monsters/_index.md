# Monsters

Monsters are any Non-Player Characters (NPCs) involved in combat. Monsters are not as mechanically fleshed out as Player Characters (PCs): they don't have classes, don't gain levels. They have two main traits: their hit dice (HD), and any special attacks they may have. Hit dice determine their power level, with 1HD being roughly equivalent to (or maybe slightly under-powered from) a 1st level character. 

Poor rolls are activities that are awkward for that creature, or that they are not designed to do. Proficient rolls are things they are used to doing regularly, like attacks. Good rolls are for the things they specialize in or are known for being especially good at. Like a giant's strength, or a tiger's stealth, or a signature attack.

Dmg describes the number of damage dice across all attacks in a round. Can be all in a single attack or spread across several attacks.

The number of special abilities is just a suggestion, but try to keep them within the theme of the monster. Some abilities shouldn't be used on monsters commonly encountered before PCs have the tools to deal with them, such as permanent ability drain.
