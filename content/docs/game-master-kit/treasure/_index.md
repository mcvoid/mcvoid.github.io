# Treasure

## How to roll

When finding a hoard, there are several types of treasure that can be found: 

* Coins (CP, SP, GP)
* Gems and Jewellry
* Magic items

For each of these is a number between 1 and 20 being the probability of finding that type of trasure. If a d20 roll meets or exceeds this number, there is that type of treasure in that hoard in the amount given in the "amt" column.

## Magic Items in the Marketplace

Magic items are not mass-produced, so the only way to procure magic items is in via a secondary market. This makes their prices and availability extremely variable. One way to deal with this is to use the treasure tables to seed the market. To determine what items are available in an area, do the following procedure:

1. Determine the appropriate treasure hoard type (A-H) for the area. Larger, more metropolitan areas will have more items, but at higher prices.
2. Roll for the amount of currency. This will be the price of the most expensive item.
3. Roll for the gems and magic items. These will be the items for sale in the secondary market.
4. List them in order of power and rarity, starting with magic items, then scrolls, then potions, then gems and jewellery.
5. Assign the currency title as the price of the first item in the list.
6. The second item is 1/2 the price as the first. The third item is 1/3 the price as the first, the fourth 1/4, and so on.
7. Each day that passes, remove an item from the list, along with removing items that were bought by the party.
8. Each month, re-roll from the same hoard type.
