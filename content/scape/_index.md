# Scape

A fantasy roleplaying game for the Planescape setting.

## Central Tenets of Scape

1. **Player characters are not superheroes.** They are denizens of the planes just like everyone else. What separates them from the rest is their choices.
2. **Even mighty heores can fall to a single stroke of a weapon.** Mortals are mortal. They are fragile. Even the mighty Achilles or Ajax is slain with a single arrow or spear stroke. The trick is to avoid getting hit, or even better avoid letting anyone want to hit you in the first place.
3. **Roleplay is not about combat, narrative, numbers, nor personality, but about choices.** The important things that happen are the ways the player characters affect the world around them.
4. **Character growth is not a growth in numbers.** Don't expect `STR` or `HP` to alter dramatically. Expect a growth in what you are capable of.
5. **Ideas and extraordinary abliities are represented as items.** Among the planes, the abstract tends to be represented as the physical. Your character's "class" is the items that give them abilities. Your level up abilities are `tattoos` you collect. Even your `XP` is represented as chips, to be traded and spent.
6. **The referee is there to challege the characters' viewpoints as much as their safety.** This is more about perspective and philosophy than it is about killing monsters. The strange creatures are to be feared for their ideas more than fang and claw.
7. **Rules are for skipping ahead in time.** We don't include rules for the important parts of the game: choices, ethics, planar travel. That's because we want you to take your time on those areas and explore them fully through roleplay and a dialogue between each other and the referee. We include rules for parts we want to get over quickly: combat, skill checks, powers, even making characters and leveling up. We made them simple and quick so they can make room for the important parts. Similarly, saves made out of combat are for skipping past unimportant bits.

## Character Creation

1. Roll `3d6`. This is your max `STR` score.
2. Roll `3d6`. This is your max `DEX` score.
3. Roll `3d6`. This is your max `WIL` score.
4. Record your `STR`, `DEX` and `WIL` edge as `0`.
5. Roll `1d6`. This is your max `HP`.
6. Add `3 days' rations` to your `inventory`. This takes only one equipment slot.
7. Pick a starting equipment set. Add these to your `inventory`.
9. Record your worn items and your weapon damage.
8. Record your `AC` based on your worn armor.
10. Roll `3d6`. This is your starting `jink`.
11. Write a sentence or two about your character's `profession` before heading out to adventure the planes.
12. Pick a name.

## Rules

1. **Basic interaction** Describe your actions to the referee. They will decide if you succeed or fail. They may ask you to roll a save to determine success.
2. **Ability scores** You have three ability scores. They act as hit points. They start as the same value as your max ability scores, and may not exceed the max. Applying effort, using special equipment, or taking damage while critically injured can result in lowering your ability scores.
  * If your `WIL` score reaches `0`, you are stupefied until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain `1 fatigue`.
  * If your `DEX` score reaches `0`, you are immobilized until a full rest or the points are healed. You gain `1 fatigue`.
  * If your `STR` score reaches `0`, you are dead. Forever.
3. **Saves** To avoid a negative effect, roll `1d20`. If the number is *less than or equal to* your relevant ability, you succeed.
4. **Advantage/Disadvantage** If an action is particularly easy, the referee may request a roll be made with `advantage`, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the more favorable roll. Conversely, if an action is particularly difficult, the referee may request a roll be made with `disadvantage`, meaning the player rolls twice and takes the less favorable roll.
5. **Effort** A player may turn a roll with `disadvantage` into a normal roll, or turn a normal roll into a roll with `advantage`, by applying `effort`. Applying `effort` gives the ability score for that roll `3 damage` after the effect of the roll is applied. A player can only apply `effort` once per roll.
6. **Edge** Activating ability in equipment or applying effort will lower ability scores by a fixed cost. Having an `edge` decreases the cost by the amount of edge for that ability score. For example, if an ability costs `3 STR`, and your `STR edge` is `1`, you lose `2 STR` to use that ability. The minimum cost is `0`.
7. **Profession** If the referee determines that the character's `profession` would result in them being more skilled than usual at that task, the player may assume a minimum `edge` of `1` for effort applied to that action.
8. **AC and `HP`** Any damage received is first reduced by your `AC` score. If `AC` cannot reduce it to `0`, then the remainder is taken from your `HP`. Once `HP` is `0`, the remaining damage dealt is taken from the relevant ability score. Physical damage reduces `STR`, while other effects like magic or poisons may affect `DEX` or `WIL` instead.
9. **Critical Damage** The moment your `HP` reaches `0` as a result of taking damage, roll a `STR` save. On a failure, you gain `1 fatigue`, you are disabled and can only moan for help and try to crawl to safety.
10. **Equipment Slots** You have `10` equipment slots to start, `4` of which are considered to be worn or carried. Each piece of equipment you take with you (except coins) takes up equipment slots. Most equipment takes up `1` slot. Small items can be grouped into a single slot. Bulky items use `2` slots. If you have no unused equipment slots, you cannot carry any more equipment and are considered `deprived`. Carrying a person is considered bulky. Equipment abilities can only be activated while wearing or carrying them.
11. **Fatigue** You may gain fatigue from various sources such as extreme heat or cold, multiple days without sleep, critical damage, or being downed from ability score damage. Each point of `fatigue` gained renders a single `inventory` slot unusable. If this leaves you with no usable inventory slots, you are `fatigued`. If you have more items equipped than you have usable slots, you must drop the remaining equipment. A full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink removes `1 fatigue`.
11. **Deprivation** Extreme environments, magical effects, and having all usable equipment slots filled causes you to be `deprived`. While `deprived`, you cannot restore `HP`, `STR`, `DEX`, nor `WIL` by resting.
12. **Healing** Resting allows damage to be recovered to the max score. `HP` can be restored with a few minutes of rest. `STR`, `DEX`, and `WIL` need a full day of rest in a safe location with food and drink to be restored. Temporary injuries can only have their effects removed with a week of bedrest and a skilled healer.

## Combat

When combat starts, the game gets a little more structured. Combat happens in the following sequence:

1. **Roll initiative** Everyone makes a `DEX` save.
2. **Surprise Turn** Everyone who passed the save takes their turn.
3. **Morale** Referee rolls to see if the characters under their control flee.
4. **Enemy Turn** Characters under referee control take their turn.
5. **Party Turn** Everyone who failed the save takes their turn.
6. **End of Round** If combat is still ongoing, go to step `1`.

### On a turn

Each character on their turn gets to move and perform an action.

Actions include, but are not limited to:

* **Attack** If the enemy is within range of the weapon, the attack succeeds. Roll the damage indicated by the weapon.
* **Unarmed Attack** If the enemy is within reach, the attack succeeds. The enemy takes `1` damage.
* **Use Equipment** They may use the equipment at a tool, or an improvsied weapon, or may activate an ability the equipment gives them. They do so by wearing or holding the equipment as appropriate. Merely carrying it (such as in a backpack) is not sufficient.
* **Interact** They may push a button, open a door, roll a barrel, or interact with any other reachable object in their environment.
* **Improvise** They may try to do anything else that the character can think of that's capable of being done in a few seconds. The referee determines the outcome.

### Morale

Each round the referee makes a determination on whether the creatures flee and end the combat. This can be done "by feel", or by doing the following procedure.

* Roll a `WIL` save on behalf of the creatures. One save for the entire group.
* If they are especially cowardly creatures, or have lost half their group, the roll with disadvantage.
* If they have an experienced leader, they roll with advantage.
* If they fail, they attempt to flee and combat is ended.

## Character Advancement

### Experience

`XP` is gained for attaining goals, discovering new places, and making critical decisions. `XP` is represented as poker chips. `1 XP` is given to each player in a group when the group as a whole is being rewarded. If a single player is being rewarded, the referee gives `2 XP` to the player: `1 XP` the player keeps for themself, `1 XP` is given to another player while stating a reason they deserve it. XP can be traded freely among players. `XP` can also be spent to "grease the wheels" of roleplaying, obtaining some minor goal without having to roleplay it or risk failure. Doing so costs the party `4XP`.

`XP` can be spent to reverse the effects of a bad roll. The player may choose to surrender `1 XP` to the referee after failing the save, and avoids whatever the most recent roll's bad effect as if it never happened. 

`XP` can also be spent to make the character stronger by purchasing `tattoos`. A player can spend `4 XP` to gain any one of the following `tattoos`. A player may not take a particular `tattoo` if it was one of their `3` most recently purchased `tattoos`. That means at most the same `tattoo` can only be gained for every `4 tattoo` purchases.

### Tattoos

* **Mark of Vitality**: This tattoo causes you to grow grotesquely muscly. You can perform great feats of strength more often, but maybe you should refrain from delicate tasks like petting kittens. Increase your `STR edge` by 1, not to exceed `2`.
* **Mark of Agility**: This tattoo causes you to be quicker and more twitchy. Your reflexes are enchanced. Never mind the occasional spasms. That's just your nervous system going into overdrive. Increase your `DEX edge` by 1, not to exceed `2`.
* **Mark of Intellect**: With this mark your neural pathways have opened and you can see the connections you couldn't before. Also, does anyone else see all the eyes everywhere? Increase your `WIL edge` by 1, not to exceed `2`.
* **Mark of Health**: You can dodge so well with this mark that time seems to move a bit slower for you. You're not sure why everyone keeps complaining about you talking so fast. Increase max `HP` by `2`.
* **Mark of Burden**: Life is a tetris game. You can see the optimal packing for your stuff. And how to optimally pack everything else, all the time. Increase your number of `inventory` slots by `1`, not to exceed `14`.
* **Mark of Skill**: Multitasking is what it's all about. You can hold so many things at once. Juggling seems trivial now. You know because you never stop doing it. Increase the number of `inventory` slots which can be worn or carried by `1`, not to exceed `6`.
* **Mark of Toughness**: Your favorite set of armor is so broken in and perfectly molded to your form that it feels like another layer of skin. That's why it feels like you're ripping your skin off whenever you remove it. Choose one armor type. Increase the `AC` of that armor type by `1` when you wear it. You may only select this `tattoo` once.
* **Mark of Arcana**: You just got your favorite scroll tattooed right on your skin so now it lives rent-free in your brain, pushing out some core memories that lived there. If you could remember what it was, you might be upset you lost it, but you can't, so you don't. Choose a scroll from your inventory. That spell is able to be cast without needing to equip a scroll. Each time you purchase this `tattoo` it must be for a different spell.

The referee should expand this list as a campaign goes on to reflect the experiences of the characters. This way the characters wear their own stories and experiences on their skin. These additional `tattoos` should be permanent abilities, such as gaining an ability from a certain item. Tattoos which improve numeric superiority should not be added.

## Equipment and Jink

The monetary currency of the planes is `jink`. Values listed in the equipment tables is their sale value. Trading in unwanted equipment typically nets half the sale value.
