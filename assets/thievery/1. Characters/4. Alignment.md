# Alignment

Alignments are cosmic principles that represent broad worldviews. All beings are categorized under three alignments: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos. These have the effect of grouping the world's denizens into three teams. None of these teams are associated with good or evil: good and evil exist in all three.

**Law:** The belief in order, justice, and civilization as the natural order of the universe. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice.

**Neutrality:** Those unaffiliated with the who notion of "teams". Neutral beings will cooperate with others as long as it is not to their detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated and believe in living by their talents rather than relying on others.

**Chaos:** The belief that civilization and authority are weak and corrupt. They recognize strength over pieces of paper containing laws, and value honor over justice. They will casually break laws and act in the interest of individual and group survival.

## Revealing Alignment

The player must inform the referee of their character’s alignment but does not have to tell other players.

## Role-Playing Alignment

Players should consider the chosen alignment when determining their character’s actions. The referee may call the player’s attention to deeds against the chosen alignment and suggest that the character changes to an alignment better fitting their behavior. Deviation from alignment may also be penalized as the referee sees fit.
